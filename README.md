## Your app collects user data. Where are your legal documents?

You added Stripe last week. OpenAI the week before. Supabase for auth. PostHog for analytics. Sentry for error tracking.

Each one collects user data. Each one requires disclosure in your privacy policy. And starting **August 2, 2026**, the EU AI Act requires you to disclose every AI system in your application — with fines up to **EUR 35 million**.

**Do you know exactly what data your app collects?** Most developers don't. Especially when half the code is AI-generated.

---

## One command. Every document you need.

```bash
npx codepliant go
```

Codepliant reads your actual source code — not a questionnaire — and generates every compliance document your project requires.

```
Scanning package.json...     ✓ 7 services detected
Scanning source imports...   ✓ OpenAI, Stripe found in code
Scanning .env...             ✓ 9 API keys detected
Scanning Prisma schema...    ✓ User model: email, phone, passwordHash

Generated 90+ documents in legal/

  PRIVACY_POLICY.md                  — mentions Stripe, OpenAI, Supabase by name
  AI_DISCLOSURE.md                   — EU AI Act Art. 50 compliant
  TERMS_OF_SERVICE.md                — SaaS terms with arbitration clause
  COOKIE_POLICY.md                   — PostHog cookies listed specifically
  DATA_PROCESSING_AGREEMENT.md       — GDPR Art. 28, lists your sub-processors
  RESPONSIBLE_DISCLOSURE_POLICY.md   — bug bounty scope, safe harbor, response timeline
  API_TERMS_OF_USE.md                — rate limits, auth, SLA for API consumers
  OPEN_SOURCE_NOTICE.md              — OSS attribution, license summaries
  INCIDENT_RESPONSE_PLAN.md          — 72-hour GDPR breach notification
  DATA_DICTIONARY.md                 — every data field cataloged with sensitivity
  ACCESS_CONTROL_POLICY.md           — RBAC, password policy, MFA requirements
  CHANGE_MANAGEMENT_POLICY.md        — code review, deployment, rollback procedures
  ... and 40+ more

Generation Summary
  Total documents: 90+
  Total lines generated: 12,000+
  Estimated lawyer equivalent: Generated 90+ documents (~$90,000 lawyer equivalent)

Compliance score: 100% (A)
Done in 24ms.
```

**Every document mentions your actual services by name.** Not "third-party analytics providers" — it says "PostHog" because it found PostHog in your code.

## The problem with existing tools

| You go to Termly/Iubenda... | You use Codepliant... |
|---|----|
| "Do you collect email addresses?" — *I think so?* | Reads `email: String @unique` from your Prisma schema |
| "Do you use cookies?" — *Probably?* | Finds PostHog, Google Analytics, Supabase Auth in your code |
| "Do you use AI?" — *Yes but what do I disclose?* | Detects OpenAI + Anthropic, generates Article 50 disclosure |
| "List your sub-processors" — *Uhh...* | Finds Stripe, Sentry, Resend, generates the full list with their DPA URLs |
| 30 minutes of forms → generic template | 30 seconds → 90+ documents tailored to your code |

---

## Who uses this

**SaaS founders** — "I need a privacy policy before launch. I don't have $2,000 for a lawyer and I don't know what half my dependencies collect."

**Developers** — "I added OpenAI last sprint. Now I need to update the privacy policy, add an AI disclosure, and figure out what the EU AI Act requires. I don't want to spend a day on this."

**CTOs preparing for audit** — "Investors want SOC 2 readiness docs. I need a privacy impact assessment, incident response plan, data processing agreements, and a third-party risk assessment. Yesterday."

**Agencies** — "I manage 15 client projects. Each needs compliance docs. `codepliant scan-all ./clients` runs them all in one shot."

---

## What it detects (from your actual code)

```
package.json:    "stripe": "^14.0"       → Payment data collection
source code:     import OpenAI from "openai"  → AI usage, needs disclosure
.env:            SENTRY_DSN=https://...   → Error monitoring, collects IPs
Prisma schema:   email String @unique     → Personal data storage
API route:       POST /api/chat { email } → Data intake endpoint
docker-compose:  postgres, redis          → Data persistence infrastructure
```

Supports: JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, Go, Ruby, Elixir, PHP, Rust, Java, .NET, Django — and frameworks like Rails, Laravel, Express, FastAPI.

## What it generates

**Legal** — Privacy Policy (GDPR Art. 13), Terms of Service, Cookie Policy, Data Processing Agreement, API Terms of Use, Refund Policy, SLA

**AI Compliance** — AI Disclosure (EU AI Act Art. 50), AI Model Card (Art. 53), AI Act Checklist, AI Governance Framework, Acceptable AI Use Policy

**Security** — Security Policy, Incident Response Plan, Vulnerability Scan, Access Control Policy, Change Management Policy, Responsible Disclosure Policy, Encryption Policy, Backup Policy, Disaster Recovery, Penetration Test Scope

**Privacy** — DSAR Handling Guide, Consent Management Guide, Data Retention Policy, Data Dictionary, Privacy by Design Checklist, Cookie Inventory, Data Subject Categories, Lawful Basis Assessment

**Operations** — Open Source Notice, License Compliance, Sub-Processor List, Vendor Contacts, Data Flow Map, Record of Processing, Transfer Impact Assessment, Regulatory Updates

**Audit** — SOC 2 Checklist, ISO 27001 Checklist, Privacy Impact Assessment, Third-Party Risk Assessment, Data Classification, Risk Register, Compliance Certificate, Annual Review Checklist

**Privacy UX** — Privacy Notice (Short) for in-app display, Cookie Consent Config (JSON) for CMP integration (OneTrust, CookieYes, Cookiebot)

**Output formats** — Markdown, HTML, PDF, JSON, Notion, Confluence, cookie consent banner, embeddable widget, 12+ formats total

## What happens when you run `codepliant go`

When you run `npx codepliant go`, here's exactly what happens under the hood:

### Step 1: Dependency Scanning (`src/scanner/dependencies.ts`)
Reads your `package.json` (or `requirements.txt`, `Gemfile`, `go.mod`, `Cargo.toml`, `composer.json`, etc.) and matches every dependency against 200+ known service signatures. Each signature maps a package name to its category (analytics, auth, payment, AI, monitoring) and the data it typically collects.

### Step 2: Source Code Import Scanning (`src/scanner/imports.ts`)
Walks your source files and detects `import` and `require()` statements. This catches services used in code but not listed as direct dependencies — like AI SDKs imported from a monorepo package or vendored libraries.

### Step 3: Environment Variable Scanning (`src/scanner/env.ts`)
Reads `.env`, `.env.local`, `.env.example`, and similar files. Matches variable names against known patterns (e.g., `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `SENTRY_DSN`) to detect services configured via environment variables.

### Step 4: Schema & Model Scanning
- **Prisma** (`src/scanner/schema.ts`) — parses `schema.prisma` to find user data fields (email, phone, passwordHash)
- **Drizzle** (`src/scanner/drizzle-models.ts`) — detects data models in Drizzle ORM schemas
- **Django** (`src/scanner/django-models.ts`) — reads `models.py` for field definitions
- **SQLAlchemy** (`src/scanner/sqlalchemy-models.ts`) — parses Python ORM models
- **Mongoose** (`src/scanner/mongoose-models.ts`) — detects MongoDB schemas
- **TypeORM** (`src/scanner/typeorm-models.ts`) — reads TypeORM entity definitions
- **Go structs** (`src/scanner/go-structs.ts`) — parses Go struct tags for data fields

### Step 5: Infrastructure Scanning
- **Docker Compose** (`src/scanner/docker-compose-services.ts`) — detects databases, caches, message queues
- **Cloud providers** (`src/scanner/cloud-scanner.ts`) — AWS, GCP, Azure configurations
- **CI/CD** (`src/scanner/ci-cd-scanner.ts`) — GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, CircleCI
- **Database** (`src/scanner/database-scanner.ts`) — connection strings, database types

### Step 6: Specialized Scanners
- **API routes** (`src/scanner/api-routes.ts`) — detects data intake endpoints
- **File uploads** (`src/scanner/file-upload-scanner.ts`) — media/document upload handling
- **Payment** (`src/scanner/payment-scanner.ts`) — Stripe, PayPal, billing integrations
- **Secrets** (`src/scanner/secrets-scanner.ts`) — hardcoded credentials detection
- **License** (`src/scanner/license-scanner.ts`) — open source license compliance

### Step 7: Document Generation (`src/generator/index.ts`)
Based on scan results, generates 90+ documents — each personalized to your actual services. A project using Stripe, OpenAI, and Supabase gets documents that mention those services by name, list their specific data collection practices, and link to their DPA pages.

### Step 8: Output & Scoring
Writes all documents to `legal/` (or your configured output directory), computes a compliance score, and shows a generation summary with estimated lawyer-equivalent value.

**Total time: typically under 1 second.** Zero network calls — everything runs locally.
