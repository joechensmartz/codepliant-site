## Purpose

This document outlines the migration strategy for each third-party service provider integrated into **codepliant**. It ensures the organization can transition away from any vendor without unacceptable disruption to service delivery or data loss.

This plan is required by enterprise Data Processing Agreements (DPAs) and demonstrates vendor independence in accordance with business continuity best practices.

For questions about vendor exit strategies, contact [your-email@example.com].

## General Migration Framework

### Phase 1: Planning (Week 1)

1. **Impact Assessment** — Identify all systems, features, and data flows dependent on the vendor
2. **Alternative Evaluation** — Score alternatives on feature parity, pricing, compliance, and data residency
3. **Stakeholder Communication** — Notify affected teams and set expectations for timeline
4. **Budget Approval** — Secure budget for migration effort and potential parallel running costs

### Phase 2: Preparation (Week 2-3)

1. **Data Export** — Execute full data export from current vendor
2. **Data Validation** — Verify export completeness and integrity
3. **Environment Setup** — Provision accounts and configure new vendor
4. **Code Changes** — Implement abstraction layer or direct replacement in codebase

### Phase 3: Migration (Week 3-4)

1. **Staging Deployment** — Deploy to staging with new vendor integration
2. **Regression Testing** — Run full test suite against new integration
3. **Performance Testing** — Verify latency, throughput, and reliability meet requirements
4. **Data Migration** — Import historical data into new vendor (if applicable)

### Phase 4: Cutover (Week 4+)

1. **Blue-Green Deployment** — Run both vendors in parallel during cutover window
2. **Production Switch** — Point production traffic to new vendor
3. **Monitoring** — Watch for errors, performance degradation, and data inconsistencies
4. **Old Vendor Cleanup** — Terminate contract, request data deletion, revoke API keys

### Phase 5: Post-Migration (Week 5+)

1. **Documentation Update** — Update privacy policy, sub-processor list, vendor contacts
2. **Compliance Review** — Verify new vendor meets all DPA and regulatory requirements
3. **Lessons Learned** — Document migration experience for future reference
4. **Audit Trail** — File migration records for compliance auditing

## Data Deletion Verification

After completing any vendor migration, verify the following:

- [ ] All personal data has been deleted from the old vendor per GDPR Art. 17
- [ ] Vendor has provided written confirmation of data deletion
- [ ] Backup copies at the vendor have been destroyed (confirm retention schedules)
- [ ] API keys and access tokens for the old vendor have been revoked
- [ ] DNS records, webhooks, and integrations pointing to old vendor have been removed

---

## Review Schedule

This vendor exit plan should be reviewed:

- **Annually** as part of the regular vendor management review
- **When adding** a new third-party vendor
- **When a vendor** changes pricing, terms, or has a significant incident
- **Before contract renewal** to evaluate whether migration is advantageous
