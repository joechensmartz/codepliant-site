> This Data Protection Impact Assessment is prepared pursuant to **Article 35 of the General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (GDPR)**. A DPIA is required when data processing is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, particularly when using new technologies.

> **Action required:** Review and update the categories of data subjects to reflect your actual processing activities.

## 2. Necessity and Proportionality Assessment

### 2.1 Lawfulness of Processing

Each data processing activity must have a valid legal basis under Article 6 GDPR:

| Processing Activity | Legal Basis | Justification |
|---------------------|-------------|---------------|
| AI processing via @anthropic-ai/sdk | Consent / Legitimate interest | Required for AI-powered features; user consent obtained before processing |
| Data processing via ActionCable | Legitimate interest | To be documented based on specific use case |
| File storage via Active Storage | Contractual necessity | Necessary to provide file storage features requested by the user |
| File storage via CarrierWave | Contractual necessity | Necessary to provide file storage features requested by the user |
| Data processing via Django Channels | Legitimate interest | To be documented based on specific use case |
| Data processing via NestJS WebSockets | Legitimate interest | To be documented based on specific use case |
| AI processing via openai | Consent / Legitimate interest | Required for AI-powered features; user consent obtained before processing |
| Behavioral analytics via posthog | Consent | Used to understand usage patterns and improve the service; requires prior consent |
| Payment processing via stripe | Contractual necessity | Necessary to process transactions requested by the user |
| File storage via UploadThing | Contractual necessity | Necessary to provide file storage features requested by the user |

### 2.2 Data Minimization

The following data minimization measures should be verified:

**AI Services:**
- [ ] Only data strictly necessary for the AI feature is transmitted to the provider
- [ ] User prompts are not stored beyond the session unless the user explicitly opts in
- [ ] No special category data is included in AI requests without explicit consent

**Analytics Services:**
- [ ] IP anonymization is enabled
- [ ] Only necessary tracking events are collected
- [ ] Session recording excludes sensitive form fields
- [ ] Data retention periods are configured to the minimum necessary

### 2.3 Proportionality

- [ ] The processing is necessary to achieve the stated purpose and cannot be achieved by less intrusive means
- [ ] The volume of data collected is proportionate to the processing purpose
- [ ] Data retention periods are limited to what is strictly necessary
- [ ] Data subjects are clearly informed about the processing

> **Action required:** Document how each processing activity satisfies the necessity and proportionality requirements. Verify that less privacy-intrusive alternatives have been considered.

## 3. Risk Assessment

### 3.1 Methodology

Risk is assessed using a **likelihood x impact** matrix. Each data processing activity is scored on two dimensions:

**Likelihood** (probability of harm occurring):

| Score | Level | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Unlikely | Remote chance of occurrence |
| 2 | Possible | Could occur in some circumstances |
| 3 | Likely | Will probably occur |
| 4 | Almost Certain | Expected to occur in most circumstances |

**Impact** (severity of harm to data subjects):

| Score | Level | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Negligible | Minor inconvenience, easily recoverable |
| 2 | Limited | Some damage, recoverable with effort |
| 3 | Significant | Serious harm, difficult to recover |
| 4 | Maximum | Irreversible or very serious harm |

**Risk Rating:** Likelihood x Impact

| Rating | Score Range | Action Required |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|
| Low | 1-4 | Accept with standard controls |
| Medium | 5-8 | Mitigate with additional controls |
| High | 9-12 | Significant mitigation required before processing |
| Critical | 13-16 | Must not proceed without DPA consultation and substantial mitigation |

### 3.2 Risk Assessment Results

| Rating | Count |
|--------|-------|
| Critical | 0 |
| High | 1 |
| Medium | 3 |
| Low | 6 |
| **Total** | **10** |

## 4. High-Risk Processing Triggers

Article 35(3) GDPR and the EDPB Guidelines on DPIAs identify specific types of processing that are likely to result in high risk. The following assessment is based on detected services:

| Trigger | Status | Description |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| Large-Scale Profiling | **TRIGGERED** | Systematic evaluation of personal aspects based on automated processing, including profiling (Art. 35(3)(a)) |
| Systematic Monitoring | **TRIGGERED** | Systematic monitoring of a publicly accessible area on a large scale (Art. 35(3)(c)) |
| Sensitive / Special Category Data | **Not detected** | Processing of special categories of data on a large scale (Art. 35(3)(b)) |
| AI-Powered Decision Making | **TRIGGERED** | Automated decision-making with legal or similarly significant effects, including AI inference and content generation (Art. 22 GDPR) |

> **3 high-risk trigger(s) detected.** This DPIA is mandatory under Article 35 GDPR. Multiple triggers increase the overall risk profile.

## 5. Data Flow Diagram

A detailed data flow map showing how personal data is collected, stored, processed, and shared across all integrated services is available in the companion document:

> **See [DATA_FLOW_MAP.md](./DATA_FLOW_MAP.md)** for the complete data flow diagram.

The data flow map covers:

- **Collection points:** How and where personal data enters the system
- **Storage locations:** Where personal data is persisted
- **Sharing / third-party transfers:** Which services receive personal data and for what purpose
- **Cross-border transfers:** Data flows outside the EEA

## 6. Risk Mitigation Measures

The following mitigation measures are recommended for each category of data processing activity detected in the application:

### 6.1 Ai (@anthropic-ai/sdk, openai)

**Current risk rating:** Medium

**Recommended measures:**

- [ ] Implement input/output filtering to prevent transmission of unnecessary personal data

- [ ] Ensure AI provider DPA is in place with SCCs for international transfers
- [ ] Implement human oversight for AI-assisted decisions affecting individuals

### 6.2 Other (ActionCable, Django Channels, NestJS WebSockets)

**Current risk rating:** Low

**Recommended measures:**

- [ ] Review data processing activities and apply data minimization

- [ ] Limit stored payment data to transaction references only
- [ ] Implement strong authentication for payment-related actions


## 7. Consultation Requirements

### 7.1 Data Protection Authority Consultation (Art. 36 GDPR)

Under Article 36 GDPR, the controller must consult the supervisory authority prior to processing where a DPIA indicates that the processing would result in a high risk in the absence of measures taken by the controller to mitigate the risk.

**Consultation required:** **YES** — Based on the risk assessment, consultation with your Data Protection Authority is recommended before proceeding with processing.

### 7.2 When to Consult

You should consult your supervisory authority when:

1. The DPIA indicates that processing would result in a high risk that cannot be sufficiently mitigated
2. You are uncertain whether your mitigation measures adequately address the identified risks
3. National law requires consultation for this type of processing

### 7.3 Consultation Process

1. Compile this DPIA and all supporting documentation
2. Document the mitigation measures you have implemented or plan to implement
3. Submit to your lead supervisory authority (the DPA in the EU Member State where your main establishment is located)
4. The DPA has up to 8 weeks (extendable by 6 weeks) to provide written advice
5. Do not proceed with the processing until you receive the DPA's response

### 7.4 Internal Consultation

Regardless of DPA consultation requirements, the following internal stakeholders should review this DPIA:

- [ ] Data Protection Officer
- [ ] Legal / Compliance team
- [ ] Engineering / Development team
- [ ] Information Security team
- [ ] Product Management
