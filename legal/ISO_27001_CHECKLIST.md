It is not a substitute for a formal ISO 27001 certification audit or professional guidance. Engage a qualified certification body for your official assessment.

## 1. Overview

This checklist helps [Your Company Name] prepare for ISO 27001 certification by mapping detected services and infrastructure to the Annex A controls defined in ISO/IEC 27001:2022. Each section contains actionable items tailored to your project's technology stack.

ISO 27001 requires an Information Security Management System (ISMS) that addresses risks through a combination of organizational, people, physical, and technological controls.

**Detected services:** 10
**Applicable Annex A domains:** Organizational Controls (A.5), People Controls (A.6), Technological Controls (A.8), Physical Controls (A.7)

## 5. Statement of Applicability (SoA) Template

The Statement of Applicability documents which Annex A controls are applicable to your ISMS and the justification for inclusion or exclusion.

| Control Domain | Applicable | Justification |
|---------------|------------|---------------|
| Organizational Controls (A.5) | Yes | Relevant services and data processing detected |
| People Controls (A.6) | Yes | Relevant services and data processing detected |
| Physical Controls (A.7) | Yes | Relevant services and data processing detected |
| Technological Controls (A.8) | Yes | Relevant services and data processing detected |

> **Note:** All Annex A domains should be evaluated regardless of detected services. This template provides a starting point — your organization must assess applicability based on the full risk assessment.

## 6. Next Steps

1. **Appoint an ISMS owner** responsible for driving the certification process.
2. **Define the ISMS scope** — which business units, locations, and systems are included.
3. **Conduct a risk assessment** to identify threats and vulnerabilities to your information assets.
4. **Prioritize controls** starting with A.5 (Organizational) and A.8 (Technological) — these have the broadest impact.
5. **Begin documentation** — ISO 27001 requires documented policies, procedures, and evidence of control operation.
6. **Engage a certification body** early to align on scope and expectations.
