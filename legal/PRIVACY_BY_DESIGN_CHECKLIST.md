**Organization:** [Your Company Name]
**Last updated:** 2026-03-16
**Legal basis:** GDPR Article 25 — Data Protection by Design and by Default

This checklist implements the requirements of GDPR Article 25, which mandates that data protection is integrated into processing activities and business practices from the design stage through the lifecycle. Each item has been tailored to the services detected in the [Your Company Name] codebase.

## 1. Data Minimization (Article 5(1)(c))

Ensure that only data which is necessary for each specific purpose is collected and processed.

- [ ] Review each data collection point to verify necessity
- [ ] Document the purpose for each category of personal data collected
- [ ] Remove any data fields that are not strictly necessary
- [ ] Implement default settings that collect the minimum data required
- [ ] Configure analytics to anonymize IP addresses
- [ ] Disable user-level tracking where aggregate data suffices
- [ ] Set analytics data retention to the shortest period needed

## 2. Purpose Limitation (Article 5(1)(b))

Data must be collected for specified, explicit, and legitimate purposes.

- [ ] Document the lawful basis for each processing activity
- [ ] Ensure data is not repurposed without additional consent
- [ ] Maintain a Record of Processing Activities (ROPA)
- [ ] Document the specific purpose for AI data processing
- [ ] Ensure AI training data usage is explicitly authorized
- [ ] Obtain explicit consent before using personal data for model training
- [ ] Limit payment data usage to transaction processing and fraud prevention
- [ ] Do not use payment data for marketing or profiling

## 3. Storage Limitation (Article 5(1)(e))

Personal data should be kept only as long as necessary for its purpose.

- [ ] Define retention periods for each category of personal data
- [ ] Implement automated data deletion/anonymization after retention period
- [ ] Document retention justification for any data kept beyond 3 years
- [ ] Configure object lifecycle policies for cloud storage buckets
- [ ] Implement automated expiration for user-uploaded content

## 4. Integrity & Confidentiality (Article 5(1)(f))

Personal data must be processed with appropriate security measures.

- [ ] Encrypt personal data at rest (AES-256 or equivalent)
- [ ] Encrypt personal data in transit (TLS 1.2+)
- [ ] Implement role-based access controls (RBAC)
- [ ] Maintain audit logs for personal data access
- [ ] Conduct regular security assessments and penetration tests
- [ ] Maintain PCI DSS compliance for payment data handling
- [ ] Use tokenization for stored payment methods

## 5. Transparency (Articles 12-14)

Data subjects must be informed about data processing in a clear and accessible manner.

- [ ] Publish a clear and accessible Privacy Policy
- [ ] Provide layered privacy notices (short + detailed)
- [ ] Inform users about their rights at the point of data collection
- [ ] Maintain an up-to-date list of sub-processors
- [ ] Disclose use of AI/automated decision-making (Article 22)
- [ ] Provide meaningful information about the logic of automated decisions
- [ ] Implement a cookie consent banner with granular controls
- [ ] Provide a clear Cookie Policy listing all tracking technologies

## 6. Data Subject Rights (Articles 15-22)

Systems must be designed to facilitate the exercise of data subject rights.

- [ ] Implement mechanisms for data access requests (Article 15)
- [ ] Support data rectification (Article 16)
- [ ] Support data erasure / right to be forgotten (Article 17)
- [ ] Support data portability in machine-readable format (Article 20)
- [ ] Implement right to restriction of processing (Article 18)
- [ ] Enable right to object to processing (Article 21)
- [ ] Respond to all DSARs within 30 days
- [ ] Implement right not to be subject to automated decision-making (Article 22)
- [ ] Provide human review option for AI-driven decisions with legal effects

## 7. Privacy-Enhancing Technologies (PETs) Recommendations

Based on the detected services and data processing activities, the following privacy-enhancing technologies are recommended:

### General

- [ ] **Pseudonymization**: Replace direct identifiers with pseudonyms in processing pipelines
- [ ] **Data masking**: Mask PII in non-production environments
- [ ] **Access logging**: Implement comprehensive audit trails for data access

### Analytics & Tracking

- [ ] **Differential privacy**: Add noise to analytics datasets to prevent re-identification
- [ ] **K-anonymity**: Ensure analytics cohorts contain at least k individuals
- [ ] **Server-side analytics**: Process analytics events server-side to reduce client data exposure
- [ ] **IP anonymization**: Truncate IP addresses before storage

### AI & Machine Learning

- [ ] **Federated learning**: Train models without centralizing personal data
- [ ] **On-device processing**: Process sensitive data locally where possible
- [ ] **Synthetic data**: Use synthetic datasets for model development and testing
- [ ] **Model explainability**: Implement interpretability tools for automated decisions

### Payment Processing

- [ ] **Tokenization**: Replace card data with non-reversible tokens
- [ ] **Point-to-point encryption (P2PE)**: Encrypt card data from capture to processing

### Data Storage

- [ ] **Encryption at rest**: Use envelope encryption with key rotation
- [ ] **Field-level encryption**: Encrypt individual PII fields in the database
- [ ] **Secure deletion**: Use cryptographic erasure for data deletion guarantees
