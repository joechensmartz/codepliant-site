## 1. Acceptance of Terms

By accessing or using the [Your Company Name] API ("API"), you agree to be bound by these API Terms of Use ("Terms"). If you are using the API on behalf of an organization, you represent that you have authority to bind that organization to these Terms.

These Terms supplement and are in addition to our [Terms of Service](./TERMS_OF_SERVICE.md) and [Privacy Policy](./PRIVACY_POLICY.md). In case of conflict, these API-specific terms prevail for API usage.

## 2. API Access & Authentication

### 2.1 API Keys

- You must register for an API key to access the API
- API keys are confidential and must not be shared or published

## 3. Rate Limits

To ensure fair usage and system stability, the following rate limits apply:

| Tier | Requests/minute | Requests/hour | Requests/day | Burst |
|------|----------------|--------------|-------------|-------|
| Free | 60 | 1,000 | 10,000 | 10/sec |

Retry-After: <seconds to wait (only on 429 responses)>
```

### 3.2 Exceeding Limits

When you exceed rate limits, the API returns HTTP 429 (Too Many Requests). Implement exponential backoff in your integration. Persistent abuse may result in temporary or permanent API access revocation.

- [Your Company Name] does not guarantee the accuracy of AI-generated content
