## 2. Lawful Basis Summary

| Processing Activity | Lawful Basis | GDPR Article | Requires LIA |
|---------------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| AI Processing | Consent / Contract performance | Art. 6(1)(a) / Art. 6(1)(b) | No |
| other | Legitimate interest | Art. 6(1)(f) | Yes |
| File Storage | Contract performance | Art. 6(1)(b) | No |
| Usage Analytics | Consent / Legitimate interest | Art. 6(1)(a) / Art. 6(1)(f) | Yes |
| Payment Processing | Contract performance / Legal obligation | Art. 6(1)(b) / Art. 6(1)(c) | No |

## 3. Detailed Assessments

### 3.1. AI Processing

**Services:** @anthropic-ai/sdk, openai

**Data processed:** user prompts, conversation history, generated content

**Lawful basis:** Consent / Contract performance (Art. 6(1)(a) / Art. 6(1)(b))

**Reasoning:**

AI processing depends on whether it is integral to the service. If AI features are core to the product the user signed up for, contract performance applies. If AI features are optional or supplementary, consent should be obtained. Special attention is required under GDPR Art. 22 regarding automated decision-making with legal or similarly significant effects.

### 3.2. other

**Services:** ActionCable, Django Channels, NestJS WebSockets

**Data processed:** real-time user data, connection metadata, channel subscriptions, WebSocket messages, channel group data, IP address

**Lawful basis:** Legitimate interest (Art. 6(1)(f))

**Reasoning:**

Processing serves the legitimate interest of providing and improving the service.

> A Legitimate Interest Assessment (LIA) is recommended for this processing activity. See Section 4 below.

### 3.3. File Storage

**Services:** Active Storage, CarrierWave, UploadThing

**Data processed:** uploaded files, file metadata, storage service credentials, potential PII in uploaded content, image versions, user identity

**Lawful basis:** Contract performance (Art. 6(1)(b))

**Reasoning:**

File storage processing is necessary to provide the storage service that the user has contracted for. The user explicitly uploads files with the expectation that they will be stored and retrievable. This is a core part of the service agreement.

### 3.4. Usage Analytics

**Services:** posthog

**Data processed:** user behavior, session recordings, feature flag usage, device information

**Lawful basis:** Consent / Legitimate interest (Art. 6(1)(a) / Art. 6(1)(f))

**Reasoning:**

Analytics processing may rely on consent (obtained via cookie banner) for tracking technologies that are not strictly necessary. Alternatively, aggregated and anonymized analytics may be processed under legitimate interest for product improvement. A Legitimate Interest Assessment should be conducted to document the balancing test if Art. 6(1)(f) is used.

> A Legitimate Interest Assessment (LIA) is recommended for this processing activity. See Section 4 below.

### 3.5. Payment Processing

**Services:** stripe

**Data processed:** payment information, billing address, email, transaction history

**Lawful basis:** Contract performance / Legal obligation (Art. 6(1)(b) / Art. 6(1)(c))

**Reasoning:**

Payment processing is necessary to fulfill the contractual obligation of delivering paid services or goods. Additionally, retention of transaction records is required under tax and accounting regulations (legal obligation). Payment card data is tokenized and processed by PCI DSS-compliant processors, minimizing the controller's exposure.

## 4. Legitimate Interest Assessments (LIA)

Under GDPR Art. 6(1)(f), processing based on legitimate interest requires a three-part test. The following assessments should be completed for each processing activity relying on this basis.

### 4.1. LIA: other

#### Part 1: Purpose Test — Identify the legitimate interest

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| What is the purpose of the processing? | Supporting service operations and improvement |
| Is there a genuine need for this processing? | [Yes/No — provide justification] |
| Who benefits from the processing? | Both the controller and data subjects |
| Would the processing be considered unethical or unlawful in any way? | No — the processing is standard industry practice |

#### Part 2: Necessity Test — Is the processing necessary?

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| Is this the least intrusive way to achieve the purpose? | [Assess whether less intrusive alternatives exist] |
| Could the same result be achieved without processing personal data? | [Assess whether anonymization is feasible] |
| Is the data collected proportionate to the purpose? | [Confirm data minimization] |

#### Part 3: Balancing Test — Do data subject rights override?

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| Nature of the data | Standard personal data — not special category |
| Reasonable expectations of the data subject | [Assess data subject expectations] |
| Likely impact on the data subject | [Assess — low/medium/high] |
| Status of the data subject (e.g., children, vulnerable) | Not specifically targeting vulnerable individuals |
| Safeguards in place | [List safeguards — encryption, access controls, retention limits] |
| Opt-out mechanism available | [Describe opt-out mechanism] |

#### LIA Conclusion

- [ ] The legitimate interest is valid and clearly identified
- [ ] The processing is necessary and proportionate
- [ ] The data subject's rights do not override the legitimate interest
- [ ] Adequate safeguards are in place
- [ ] An opt-out mechanism is available

**Decision:** [Approved / Rejected / Needs further review]
**Reviewed by:** [Name and role]
**Review date:** [Date]

### 4.2. LIA: Usage Analytics

#### Part 1: Purpose Test — Identify the legitimate interest

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| What is the purpose of the processing? | Product improvement, understanding user behavior, optimizing user experience, and measuring feature adoption |
| Is there a genuine need for this processing? | [Yes/No — provide justification] |
| Who benefits from the processing? | Both the controller (product insights) and data subjects (improved user experience) |
| Would the processing be considered unethical or unlawful in any way? | No — the processing is standard industry practice |

#### Part 2: Necessity Test — Is the processing necessary?

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| Is this the least intrusive way to achieve the purpose? | Consider whether fully anonymized analytics could serve the same purpose. If not, ensure data minimization and pseudonymization are applied. |
| Could the same result be achieved without processing personal data? | [Assess whether anonymization is feasible] |
| Is the data collected proportionate to the purpose? | [Confirm data minimization] |

#### Part 3: Balancing Test — Do data subject rights override?

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| Nature of the data | Pseudonymized behavioral data — not special category data |
| Reasonable expectations of the data subject | Users generally expect websites to track usage for improvement, though expectations vary by audience. Transparency is key. |
| Likely impact on the data subject | [Assess — low/medium/high] |
| Status of the data subject (e.g., children, vulnerable) | Not specifically targeting vulnerable individuals |
| Safeguards in place | [List safeguards — encryption, access controls, retention limits] |
| Opt-out mechanism available | Yes — via cookie preferences and account settings |

#### LIA Conclusion

- [ ] The legitimate interest is valid and clearly identified
- [ ] The processing is necessary and proportionate
- [ ] The data subject's rights do not override the legitimate interest
- [ ] Adequate safeguards are in place
- [ ] An opt-out mechanism is available

**Decision:** [Approved / Rejected / Needs further review]
**Reviewed by:** [Name and role]
**Review date:** [Date]

## Review Notes

### What a lawyer should check

- Validate each lawful basis selection against the specific processing context
- Complete all LIA templates with specific factual assessments
- Verify consent mechanisms meet GDPR requirements
- Confirm Art. 6(1)(b) claims are truly necessary for contract performance
- Review whether any processing requires a DPIA under Art. 35
