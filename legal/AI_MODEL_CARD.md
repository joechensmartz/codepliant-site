## Anthropic Claude

### Overview

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Model / Service** | Anthropic Claude |
| **Provider** | Anthropic |
| **Service Identifier** | `@anthropic-ai/sdk` |
| **Use Case in This Application** | Natural language processing, content generation, conversational AI |
| **Risk Classification** | Limited |

### Data Inputs

The following data types are sent to this AI service based on code analysis:

- user prompts
- conversation history
- generated content

### Known Limitations

- May generate plausible-sounding but factually incorrect information
- Knowledge cutoff limits awareness of recent events
- May refuse tasks it misclassifies as potentially harmful
- Limited multimodal capabilities compared to text-only performance

### Bias Considerations

- Training data reflects biases present in internet text corpora
- Constitutional AI training aims to reduce harmful biases but may not eliminate all
- Performance may vary across languages and cultural contexts
- May exhibit sycophantic behaviour, agreeing with users rather than providing accurate information

### Performance Metrics

> **Placeholder:** See Anthropic model cards and technical reports for benchmark results
>
> Operators deploying this AI system should document application-specific performance metrics including accuracy, false positive/negative rates, and fairness metrics relevant to their use case.

| Metric | Value | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Accuracy | _To be measured_ | Measure against application-specific test set |
| Latency (p50) | _To be measured_ | Median response time in production |
| Latency (p99) | _To be measured_ | 99th percentile response time |
| Error rate | _To be measured_ | Rate of failed or invalid responses |
| Fairness | _To be measured_ | Evaluate across demographic groups relevant to use case |

### Training Data Transparency

- **Provider documentation:** [Anthropic Research & Documentation](https://www.anthropic.com/research)
- **Training data disclosure:** Refer to the provider's published model card and technical reports for details on training data composition, filtering, and governance
- **Data governance:** Review the provider's data processing agreement for information on how training data is sourced, curated, and maintained

## OpenAI GPT-4 / GPT-4o

### Overview

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Model / Service** | OpenAI GPT-4 / GPT-4o |
| **Provider** | OpenAI |
| **Service Identifier** | `openai` |
| **Use Case in This Application** | Natural language processing, content generation, conversational AI |
| **Risk Classification** | Limited |

### Data Inputs

The following data types are sent to this AI service based on code analysis:

- user prompts
- conversation history
- generated content

### Known Limitations

- May generate plausible-sounding but factually incorrect information (hallucination)
- Knowledge cutoff limits awareness of recent events
- Limited ability to perform mathematical reasoning reliably
- Cannot access real-time information or browse the internet unless explicitly configured

### Bias Considerations

- Training data reflects biases present in internet text corpora
- May exhibit cultural, gender, or demographic biases in generated outputs
- Performance may vary across languages, with strongest performance in English
- Stereotypical associations may appear in open-ended generation tasks

### Performance Metrics

## Article 53 Compliance Summary

The EU AI Act Article 53 requires providers of general-purpose AI models to:

### 53(1) — Technical Documentation
- [ ] Maintain up-to-date technical documentation for each GPAI model used
- [ ] Documentation covers model training, testing, and evaluation results
- [ ] Information is sufficient for downstream providers to comply with their obligations

### 53(1)(a) — Model Identification
- [ ] Each AI model is clearly identified with name, version, and provider
- [ ] Model capabilities and limitations are documented
- [ ] Intended and foreseeable use cases are described

### 53(1)(b) — Training & Testing
- [ ] Training data sources and governance are documented (or referenced from provider)
- [ ] Evaluation results and benchmark performance are recorded
- [ ] Testing methodology is described or referenced

### 53(1)(c) — Integration Information
- [ ] Information for downstream integrators is provided
- [ ] API usage, data flow, and processing scope are documented
- [ ] Known risks and mitigation measures are communicated

### 53(1)(d) — Copyright Compliance
- [ ] Provider's copyright policy for training data is reviewed
- [ ] EU Copyright Directive (Directive (EU) 2019/790) compliance is verified with provider
- [ ] Text and data mining opt-out mechanisms are documented where applicable

### 53(2) — Systemic Risk (if applicable)
- [ ] Assess whether any GPAI model used has systemic risk (>10^25 FLOPs or EC designation)
- [ ] If systemic risk applies, additional obligations under Article 55 must be met
- [ ] Model evaluation and adversarial testing documentation is maintained

> **Note:** As a deployer (not provider) of GPAI models, your primary obligation is to ensure that the AI providers you use comply with Article 53. This checklist helps you verify and document that compliance.
