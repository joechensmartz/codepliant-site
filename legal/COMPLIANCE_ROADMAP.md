| Phase 2 | Weeks 2-4 | Security & Incident Response | **High** |
| Phase 3 | Month 2 | Advanced Compliance & Audit | **Medium** |
| Phase 4 | Ongoing | Monitoring, Updates & Reviews | **Continuous** |

## Phase 1: Essential Documents (Week 1)

> **Goal:** Get the minimum viable legal documents published on your website.

These documents carry the highest legal risk if missing. Without them, you are exposed to regulatory fines and user complaints.

### Week 1, Days 1-2: Privacy & Terms

- [ ] **Review and publish Privacy Policy** (`PRIVACY_POLICY.md`)
  - Replace all placeholder values (`[Your Company Name]`, `[your-email@example.com]`)
  - Verify all 10 detected services are correctly listed
  - Add to website footer
  - GDPR Art. 13 requires this to be accessible before data collection

- [ ] **Review and publish Terms of Service** (`TERMS_OF_SERVICE.md`)
  - Customize limitation of liability amounts
  - Review arbitration clause (modify for your jurisdiction)
  - Add to website footer alongside Privacy Policy

- [ ] **Publish AI Disclosure** (`AI_DISCLOSURE.md`)
  - EU AI Act Art. 50 — must disclose AI system usage to users

- [ ] **Review AI Model Card** (`AI_MODEL_CARD.md`)
  - Document model capabilities, limitations, and intended use
  - Required for high-risk AI systems under EU AI Act Art. 53

### Week 1, Day 5: Payment Compliance

- [ ] **Publish Refund Policy** (`REFUND_POLICY.md`)
  - Required in EU (14-day cooling-off period for digital services)
  - Customize refund window and process for your business model

  ```yaml
  # .github/workflows/compliance.yml
  - uses: codepliant/codepliant@v220
    with:
      fail-on-missing: true
  ```

- [ ] **Install pre-commit hook**
