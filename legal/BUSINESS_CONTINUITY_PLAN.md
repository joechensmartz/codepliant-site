This Business Continuity Plan (BCP) defines recovery objectives, failover procedures, and communication protocols for **[Your Company Name]**'s **codepliant** application. It ensures that critical services can be restored within acceptable timeframes following an outage, disaster, or other disruptive event.

## 1. Recovery Objectives by Service

Recovery Time Objective (RTO) defines the maximum acceptable downtime. Recovery Point Objective (RPO) defines the maximum acceptable data loss window.

### 1.1 Critical Services (RTO: 1 hour, RPO: 0–5 minutes)

Services whose outage immediately prevents users from accessing core functionality.

| Service | Category | RTO | RPO | Recovery Strategy |
|---------|----------|-----|-----|-------------------|
| stripe | Payment Processing | 1 hour | 0 minutes | Transaction queue with retry; idempotency keys |

### 1.2 High Priority Services (RTO: 4 hours, RPO: 1 hour)

Services that support core functionality but have workarounds available.

| Service | Category | RTO | RPO | Recovery Strategy |
|---------|----------|-----|-----|-------------------|
| Active Storage | Storage | 4 hours | 1 hour | Cross-region replication; CDN fallback |
| CarrierWave | Storage | 4 hours | 1 hour | Cross-region replication; CDN fallback |
| UploadThing | Storage | 4 hours | 1 hour | Cross-region replication; CDN fallback |
| @anthropic-ai/sdk | AI Service | 4 hours | 1 hour | Graceful degradation; disable AI features |
| openai | AI Service | 4 hours | 1 hour | Graceful degradation; disable AI features |

### 1.3 Standard Services (RTO: 24 hours, RPO: 24 hours)

Services whose outage is noticeable but does not prevent core operations.

| Service | Category | RTO | RPO | Recovery Strategy |
|---------|----------|-----|-----|-------------------|
| posthog | Analytics | 24 hours | 24 hours | Data buffering; delayed processing |

## 2. Infrastructure Overview

Cloud provider details should be documented here. Run a cloud scan to auto-populate.

### 2.2 Architecture Diagram

```
[TODO: Insert or link to architecture diagram showing:]
- Application servers and their locations
- Database servers and replication topology
- CDN and edge locations
- Third-party service dependencies
- Network connectivity and failover paths
```

## 3. Failover Procedures

### 3.1 Database Failover

1. **Detection** — Automated monitoring detects database unavailability
2. **Assessment** — Determine if the outage is transient (retry) or persistent (failover)
3. **Failover Execution**
   - [ ] Promote read replica to primary (if using replication)
   - [ ] Update connection strings / DNS records
   - [ ] Verify application connectivity to new primary
   - [ ] Validate data integrity after failover
4. **Communication** — Notify engineering team and update status page
5. **Recovery** — Rebuild failed node and re-establish replication

### 3.2 Application Failover

1. **Detection** — Health check failures trigger failover
2. **Traffic Routing** — Load balancer / DNS routes traffic to healthy instances
3. **Scaling** — Auto-scale additional instances if capacity is reduced
4. **Verification** — Confirm application functionality in failover state

### 3.4 Payment Service Failover

Detected payment service(s): stripe

- [ ] Queue pending transactions for retry when service is restored
- [ ] Display user-facing message about temporary payment unavailability
- [ ] Do NOT attempt to reprocess payments without idempotency keys
- [ ] Notify finance team of any transactions in uncertain state
- [ ] After restoration, reconcile all queued transactions

### 3.5 AI Service Failover

Detected AI service(s): @anthropic-ai/sdk, openai

- [ ] Activate graceful degradation (disable AI features, show fallback content)
- [ ] Queue AI requests for processing when service is restored (if applicable)
- [ ] Display user-facing notice that AI features are temporarily unavailable
- [ ] Monitor AI provider status page for restoration timeline

## 4. Backup Strategy

### 4.1 Backup Schedule

| Data Type | Frequency | Retention | Storage Location | Encryption |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------------|------------|
| Production database | Continuous (streaming) + daily snapshot | 30 days | [Backup region] | AES-256 at rest |
| User-uploaded files | Daily incremental, weekly full | 90 days | [Backup region] | AES-256 at rest |
| Application configuration | On every change (version control) | Indefinite | Git repository | In transit (TLS) |
| Secrets and credentials | On rotation | Current + 1 previous | Secret manager | Envelope encryption |
| Audit logs | Daily export | 1 year minimum | [Compliance storage] | AES-256 at rest |

### 4.2 Backup Verification

- [ ] Automated backup verification runs daily (check backup completeness and integrity)
- [ ] Monthly restore drill — restore from backup to a staging environment
- [ ] Quarterly full disaster recovery test (see Section 8)
- [ ] Document all backup test results and any issues found

## 5. Communication Plan

### 5.1 Internal Communication

| Severity | Notify | Channel | Timeline |
|----------|--------|---------|----------|
| Critical (P1) | All engineering + leadership | Slack/Teams war room + phone | Immediately |
| High (P2) | Engineering lead + on-call | Slack/Teams channel | Within 30 minutes |
| Medium (P3) | Engineering team | Slack/Teams channel | Within 2 hours |
| Low (P4) | Relevant team | Ticket / async update | Within 24 hours |

### 5.2 External Communication

| Audience | Channel | Responsibility | Template |
|----------|---------|---------------|----------|
| Users / Customers | Status page + in-app banner | Communications Lead | See 5.4 |
| Enterprise clients | Direct email / Slack | Account Management | See 5.4 |
| Regulators (if data breach) | Formal notification | DPO / Legal | See Incident Response Plan |
| Partners / Vendors | Email | Business Operations | As needed |

### 5.3 Escalation Path
