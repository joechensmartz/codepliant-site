## In Development / Under Review

### UK Data (Use and Access) Act (DUAA)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Enforcement Date** | Royal Assent: November 2024; enforcement phased 2025-2026 |
| **Status** | Phased enforcement |

**Impact:** Reforms UK data protection law to diverge from EU GDPR. Key changes: replaces DPO requirement with 'Senior Responsible Individual'; introduces 'recognised legitimate interests' that do not require balancing test; reforms automated decision-making rules (removes Art. 22 equivalent for some decisions); new cookie rules allowing broader analytics without consent.

**Action Required:** Review DPO arrangements — may transition to Senior Responsible Individual model under UK law while maintaining DPO for EU GDPR compliance. Reassess cookie consent for UK users (analytics cookies may no longer require prior consent). Update international transfer mechanisms to use UK IDTA or UK Addendum. Monitor ICO implementation guidance.

### UK AI Regulation — Sector-led Framework

| | |
|---|---|
| **Enforcement Date** | Ongoing — no single enforcement date |
| **Status** | In development |

**Impact:** The UK has opted for a sector-led, principles-based approach rather than a single AI law. Existing regulators (ICO, FCA, CMA, Ofcom) are developing AI guidance for their sectors. The AI Safety Institute conducts frontier model evaluations.

**Action Required:** Monitor guidance from sector regulators relevant to your industry. Implement the five cross-sector AI principles: safety, fairness, transparency, accountability, contestability. Consider voluntary compliance with the UK AI Code of Practice.

### EU ePrivacy Regulation (proposed replacement for Directive 2002/58/EC)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Enforcement Date** | No confirmed date — legislative process stalled |
| **Status** | Stalled |

**Impact:** If adopted, would replace the ePrivacy Directive with a directly applicable regulation. Expected changes: harmonised cookie rules across EU, expanded scope to cover OTT communications (WhatsApp, Messenger), stricter consent requirements for metadata processing, and potential shift toward browser-level consent settings.

**Action Required:** Continue complying with current ePrivacy Directive (transposed into national law). Monitor EU legislative progress — the proposal has been in trilogue since 2021 with no agreement. Ensure current cookie consent mechanisms meet the strictest national implementation (e.g., CNIL, BfDI guidance).

### EU-US Data Privacy Framework (DPF) — Adequacy Review

| | |
|---|---|
| **Enforcement Date** | First review expected by July 2025 |
| **Status** | Under review |

**Impact:** You use 4 US-based service(s). The DPF adequacy decision enables EU-US data transfers without SCCs, but is subject to periodic review. A CJEU challenge (similar to Schrems I/II) remains possible.

**Action Required:** Verify each US-based provider's DPF certification at dataprivacyframework.gov. Maintain fallback SCCs in DPAs in case the DPF is invalidated. Document transfer impact assessments.
