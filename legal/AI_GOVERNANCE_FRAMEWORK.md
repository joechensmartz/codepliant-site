This AI Governance Framework establishes the policies, roles, and controls for the responsible development, deployment, and operation of AI systems within **[Your Company Name]**. It is aligned with the **EU AI Act** (Regulation (EU) 2024/1689) and the **NIST AI Risk Management Framework** (AI RMF 1.0).

## 1. Scope and Applicability

This framework applies to all AI systems developed, deployed, or procured by the organization, including:

- **@anthropic-ai/sdk** — user prompts, conversation history, generated content
- **openai** — user prompts, conversation history, generated content

This includes both internally developed AI models and third-party AI services accessed via APIs.

## 2. Regulatory Alignment

### 2.1 EU AI Act

The EU AI Act establishes a risk-based regulatory framework for AI systems. This project is classified as follows:

| Aspect | Classification |
|--------|---------------|
| Risk Level | Limited |

## 6. AI Risk Assessment Matrix

### 6.1 Risk Categories (EU AI Act)

| Risk Level | Definition | Requirements | Examples |
|------------|------------|--------------|----------|
| **Unacceptable** | AI systems that pose clear threats to safety, livelihoods, or rights | Prohibited | Social scoring, real-time biometric surveillance |
| **High** | AI systems that significantly impact health, safety, or fundamental rights | Conformity assessment, registration, human oversight, logging | Credit scoring, hiring, healthcare diagnosis |
| **Limited** | AI systems that interact with humans or generate content | Transparency obligations (user notification) | Chatbots, content generation, emotion detection |
| **Minimal** | AI systems with minimal risk to rights or safety | No mandatory requirements (voluntary codes of conduct) | Spam filters, game AI, search ranking |

### 6.2 Project Risk Assessment

Based on the detected AI services and their usage patterns, this project is classified as **limited risk**.

> **Action Required:** Limited-risk AI systems must comply with transparency obligations. Users must be informed they are interacting with AI, and AI-generated content must be labeled as such.

## 7. Bias Testing Requirements

### 7.1 Testing Obligations

AI systems must be tested for bias before initial deployment and at regular intervals. The EU AI Act (Article 10) requires that training, validation, and testing datasets be:

- Representative of the intended user population
- Free from errors and data quality issues
- Assessed for biases that could lead to discriminatory outcomes

### 7.2 Protected Characteristics

Test for differential impact across the following protected characteristics (per EU anti-discrimination law and jurisdiction-specific requirements):

| Characteristic | Testing Approach |
|----------------|-----------------|
| Race / Ethnicity | Compare outputs across diverse demographic inputs |
| Gender / Gender Identity | Test with gender-varied inputs; check for stereotyping |
| Age | Verify no age-based discrimination in outputs |
| Disability | Test accessibility and equitable treatment |
| Religion / Belief | Check for religious bias in content generation |
| Sexual Orientation | Verify inclusive and non-discriminatory outputs |
| Nationality / National Origin | Test for geographic or nationality-based bias |
| Socioeconomic Status | Check for class-based bias in recommendations or decisions |

### 7.3 Testing Methodology

1. **Baseline evaluation** — Establish performance metrics across demographic groups
2. **Counterfactual testing** — Swap protected attributes and verify consistent outcomes
3. **Red teaming** — Dedicated adversarial testing to elicit biased responses
4. **User feedback analysis** — Monitor production feedback for bias reports
5. **Quantitative metrics** — Calculate demographic parity, equalized odds, and calibration across groups

### 7.4 Testing Schedule

| Trigger | Action Required |
|---------|----------------|
| Pre-deployment | Full bias testing suite |
| Model update / version change | Re-run bias tests on new model |
| Quarterly | Scheduled bias review using production data |
| Incident report | Ad-hoc bias investigation |
| Regulatory request | Full audit documentation |

### 7.5 Remediation

When bias is detected:

1. Document the bias finding, affected groups, and severity
2. Assess whether to disable the feature, add guardrails, or retrain
3. Implement mitigation (prompt engineering, output filtering, model fine-tuning)
4. Re-test to verify the bias has been addressed
5. Update this framework and related documentation
6. If the bias caused harm, follow the Incident Response Plan

## 8. Transparency and Documentation Requirements

### 8.1 User-Facing Transparency

- Users must be informed when they are interacting with an AI system (EU AI Act Art. 50)
- AI-generated content must be clearly labeled as such
- Users must have access to meaningful information about the logic involved
- Opt-out mechanisms should be provided where technically feasible

### 8.2 Technical Documentation (EU AI Act Annex IV)

Maintain the following documentation for each AI system:

- [ ] General description of the AI system and its intended purpose
- [ ] Description of the elements of the AI system and its development process
- [ ] Detailed information about monitoring, functioning, and control
- [ ] Description of the risk management system
- [ ] Data governance and management practices
- [ ] Performance metrics and testing results
- [ ] Description of human oversight measures

## 9. AI-Specific Incident Response

AI-related incidents must be handled according to the organization's Incident Response Plan with the following additional considerations:

| Incident Type | Severity | Immediate Action |
|---------------|----------|-----------------|
| Data leak via AI processing | Critical | Disable AI feature, assess data exposure |
| Systematic bias detected | High | Implement output filtering, conduct investigation |
| Prompt injection exploit | High | Block attack vector, review all affected outputs |
| Model producing harmful content | High | Disable feature, apply content filters |
| Performance degradation / drift | Medium | Investigate root cause, consider rollback |
| User complaint about AI accuracy | Low-Medium | Review specific case, update training data |

For incidents involving high-risk AI systems under the EU AI Act, the following additional reporting obligations apply:

- Report serious incidents to the relevant national market surveillance authority
- Notify the AI provider (for third-party AI services)
- Document corrective actions and timeline
