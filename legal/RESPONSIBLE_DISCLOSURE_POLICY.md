This policy describes how to report security vulnerabilities to us, what you can expect from us, and what we expect from you.

### 2.1 In Scope

The following assets and services are within the scope of this program:

| Asset | Type | Priority |
|-------|------|----------|

The following are **not** in scope:

- Third-party services not operated by [Your Company Name]
- Social engineering attacks (phishing, vishing, etc.)
- Physical security attacks
- Denial of service (DoS/DDoS) attacks
- Automated vulnerability scanning that generates excessive traffic
- Issues in third-party dependencies with no demonstrated exploit path
- Clickjacking on pages with no sensitive actions
- Missing security headers without demonstrated impact

## 3. How to Report

### 3.1 Reporting Channel

Send vulnerability reports to: **security@example.com]**

### 3.2 Required Information

Please include the following in your report:

1. **Description** — Clear description of the vulnerability
2. **Steps to reproduce** — Detailed steps to reproduce the issue
3. **Impact assessment** — Your assessment of the potential impact
4. **Affected component** — URL, API endpoint, or system affected
5. **Proof of concept** — Screenshots, logs, or code demonstrating the issue
6. **Your contact information** — Email or secure communication channel

### 3.3 Encryption

For sensitive reports, we encourage encrypting your communication. Please request our PGP public key by emailing security@example.com] with the subject line "PGP Key Request".

## 4. Vulnerability Categories

We classify vulnerabilities by severity using the CVSS v3.1 framework:

| Severity | CVSS Score | Examples |
|----------|-----------|----------|
| **Critical** | 9.0 - 10.0 | Remote code execution, authentication bypass, SQL injection with data exfiltration |
| **High** | 7.0 - 8.9 | Privilege escalation, stored XSS with session hijacking, IDOR exposing PII |
| **Medium** | 4.0 - 6.9 | CSRF on sensitive actions, reflected XSS, information disclosure |
| **Low** | 0.1 - 3.9 | Verbose error messages, missing rate limiting on non-critical endpoints |

### 4.1 Priority Areas

Based on our technology stack, we are particularly interested in:

- **Payment Security** — transaction manipulation, price tampering, payment data exposure (stripe)
- **Data Storage** — injection, unauthorized data access, data leakage (Active Storage, CarrierWave, UploadThing)

### 5.1 Researcher Obligations

To qualify for safe harbor, you must:

- Act in good faith and avoid privacy violations, data destruction, or service disruption
- Only interact with accounts you own or have explicit permission to test
- Not access, modify, or delete data belonging to other users
- Stop testing and report immediately if you encounter user data
- Not publicly disclose the vulnerability before we have addressed it
- Provide us a reasonable time to fix the issue before any disclosure

## 6. Response Timeline

We commit to the following response timeline:

| Stage | Timeline |
