This Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP) defines the procedures for recovering **[Your Company Name]**'s **codepliant** application from catastrophic failures, including complete infrastructure loss, data corruption, security breaches, and natural disasters. It complements the Business Continuity Plan (BCP) and Incident Response Plan.

## 1. Disaster Scenarios and Classification

| Scenario | Severity | RTO Target | RPO Target | Trigger |
|----------|----------|------------|------------|---------|
| Complete data center / region outage | Critical | 4 hours | 5 minutes | Cloud provider outage, natural disaster |
| Database corruption or loss | Critical | 2 hours | 5 minutes | Hardware failure, human error, malicious action |
| Ransomware / security breach | Critical | 4 hours | 0 minutes (from clean backup) | Cyberattack |
| Application deployment failure | High | 1 hour | 0 minutes | Bad deployment, configuration error |
| Third-party service permanent shutdown | High | 24 hours | 1 hour | Vendor bankruptcy, API deprecation |
| DNS / CDN failure | High | 2 hours | N/A | DNS provider outage, DDoS |
| Data corruption (silent) | Medium | 24 hours | Depends on detection time | Software bug, migration error |

## 2. Recovery Procedures per Service

### 2.1 Payment Services

**Affected services:** stripe

**Recovery Procedure:**

1. **Assess transaction state:**
   - [ ] Identify any in-flight transactions at time of disaster
   - [ ] Check payment processor dashboard for transaction status
   - [ ] Document any transactions in uncertain state
2. **Restore payment integration:**
   - [ ] Verify payment processor API keys (rotate if compromised)
   - [ ] Verify webhook endpoints are receiving events
   - [ ] Re-process any failed webhook deliveries
3. **Reconciliation:**

5. [ ] Regenerate any derived files (thumbnails, transcoded media)

### 2.3 AI Services

**Affected services:** @anthropic-ai/sdk, openai

**Recovery Procedure:**

1. [ ] Verify AI provider API status and connectivity
2. [ ] Re-configure API keys if compromised
3. [ ] Restore any cached AI model configurations or fine-tuning data from backup
4. [ ] Re-enable AI features gradually (canary rollout)
5. [ ] Verify AI output quality before full restoration

### 2.4 Application Infrastructure

**Recovery Procedure:**

1. **Infrastructure provisioning:**
   - [ ] Provision compute resources in recovery region
   - [ ] Configure networking, load balancers, and DNS
   - [ ] Deploy application from latest known-good container image or build
2. **Configuration:**
   - [ ] Restore environment variables from secrets manager
   - [ ] Update service connection strings to recovered infrastructure
   - [ ] Configure SSL/TLS certificates
3. **Deployment:**
   - [ ] Trigger deployment pipeline targeting recovery infrastructure
   - [ ] Run health checks and smoke tests
   - [ ] Verify all external integrations are connected
4. **DNS cutover:**
   - [ ] Update DNS records to point to recovery infrastructure
   - [ ] Verify DNS propagation
   - [ ] Monitor traffic routing
