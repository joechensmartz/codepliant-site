## Your scan detected 10 service(s)

**Services found:** @anthropic-ai/sdk, ActionCable, Active Storage, CarrierWave, Django Channels, NestJS WebSockets, openai, posthog, stripe, UploadThing

Codepliant has generated your compliance documents in the `legal/` directory. Follow the steps below to go from "generated" to "deployed."

---

## Step 1: Review Your Privacy Policy

Your `PRIVACY_POLICY.md` has been tailored to your actual code. It mentions every service detected by name — not generic placeholders.

**What to do:**

1. Open `legal/PRIVACY_POLICY.md`
2. Search for `[Your Company Name]` and replace with your actual company name
3. Search for `[your-email@example.com]` and replace with your privacy contact email
4. Review each section — especially "Third-Party Services" and "Data Collection"
5. Have a lawyer review before publishing (the document includes a disclaimer)

> **AI Notice:** Your project uses AI services. Review `AI_DISCLOSURE.md` carefully — the EU AI Act (effective August 2, 2026) requires specific disclosures.

**Estimated time:** 15-30 minutes

## Step 2: Add Documents to Your Website

Your compliance documents need to be publicly accessible. Here's how to add them for your stack:

### Django

```python
# views.py
from django.shortcuts import render
import markdown

def privacy_policy(request):
    with open('legal/PRIVACY_POLICY.md') as f:
        content = markdown.markdown(f.read())
    return render(request, 'legal/privacy.html', {'content': content})
```

```python
# urls.py
urlpatterns = [
    path('legal/privacy/', views.privacy_policy, name='privacy_policy'),
]
```

> **Pro tip:** Run `npx codepliant go --format html` to generate ready-to-serve HTML versions of all documents.

---

## Step 3: Set Up Cookie Consent

Your project uses analytics services that set cookies. You need a cookie consent banner to comply with GDPR and ePrivacy Directive.

**Your `COOKIE_CONSENT_CONFIG.json` is ready.** It contains machine-readable cookie definitions for popular consent management platforms.

### Option A: Use a CMP (recommended)

Import your cookie config into one of these platforms:

| Platform | Free Tier | Setup |
|----------|-----------|-------|
| [CookieYes](https://www.cookieyes.com) | Up to 100 pages | Copy `COOKIE_CONSENT_CONFIG.json` |
| [Cookiebot](https://www.cookiebot.com) | Up to 100 pages | Import cookie declarations |
| [OneTrust](https://www.onetrust.com) | Enterprise | Use cookie inventory |

### Option B: Build your own

Use the `COOKIE_INVENTORY.md` as a reference to build a custom consent banner. Your inventory lists every cookie by name, purpose, duration, and category.

---

## Step 4: Configure CI/CD

Keep your compliance documents in sync with your code. When you add a new service, your docs should update automatically.

### GitHub Actions (recommended)

```yaml
# .github/workflows/compliance.yml
name: Compliance Check
on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  compliance:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: codepliant/codepliant@v220
        with:
          fail-on-missing: true
```

This will:
- Scan your code on every push and PR
- Fail the build if compliance docs are missing or outdated
- Comment on PRs with compliance impact

### GitLab CI

```yaml
compliance:
  image: node:20
  script:
    - npx codepliant check
  rules:
    - if: $CI_PIPELINE_SOURCE == "merge_request_event"
```

### Pre-commit Hook

```bash
# Install a git hook that checks compliance before every commit
npx codepliant hook install
```

---

## Step 5: Ongoing Maintenance

Compliance is not "set and forget." Here's your maintenance schedule:

| Frequency | Action | Command |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| Every commit | Auto-check via CI/CD | `codepliant check` |
| Weekly | Review compliance dashboard | `codepliant dashboard` |
| Monthly | Re-scan and update docs | `codepliant update` |
| Quarterly | Full compliance review | `codepliant report` |
| Annually | Annual review checklist | See `ANNUAL_REVIEW_CHECKLIST.md` |

---
