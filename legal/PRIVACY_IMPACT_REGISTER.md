> **Important:** This Privacy Impact Register is auto-generated based on automated code analysis. It identifies processing activities that may require a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) under GDPR Art. 35(1). Each entry should be reviewed, completed, and signed off by the DPO. This register must be maintained as a living document and updated whenever new processing activities are introduced or existing ones change materially.

## 1. Purpose

This register tracks all Privacy Impact Assessments (PIAs) and Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs) conducted by [Your Company Name]. Under GDPR Art. 35(1), a DPIA is required when processing is "likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons."

This register serves to:

- Maintain a complete inventory of all PIAs/DPIAs conducted
- Track the status, outcome, and follow-up actions for each assessment
- Demonstrate accountability to supervisory authorities (GDPR Art. 5(2))
- Schedule timely reviews and reassessments
- Identify processing activities that require new or updated assessments

## 2. When a DPIA Is Required

Under GDPR Art. 35(3), a DPIA is mandatory when processing involves:

- [ ] Systematic and extensive evaluation of personal aspects (profiling)
- [ ] Processing of special categories of data on a large scale
- [ ] Systematic monitoring of a publicly accessible area on a large scale
- [ ] Automated decision-making with legal or significant effects
- [ ] Large-scale processing of personal data
- [ ] Matching or combining datasets from different sources
- [ ] Processing data of vulnerable individuals (children, employees)
- [ ] Innovative use of new technologies
- [ ] Cross-border data transfers outside EEA
- [ ] Processing that prevents data subjects from exercising a right or using a service

### When to Consult

- [ ] The DPIA reveals residual high risks that cannot be sufficiently mitigated
- [ ] The supervisory authority's published list requires consultation for this type of processing
- [ ] The processing involves cross-border transfers with no adequacy decision or appropriate safeguards
