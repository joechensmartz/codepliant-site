## Purpose

This matrix defines severity levels for security incidents and service disruptions. It establishes response times, escalation paths, and communication requirements to ensure consistent and rapid incident handling.

---

## 1. Severity Level Definitions

| Level | Name | Definition | Examples |
|-------|------|-----------|----------|
| **P0** | **Catastrophic** | Complete system compromise, active data exfiltration, or regulatory breach affecting all users | Production database breach, ransomware encrypting all systems, leaked master encryption keys, complete auth bypass |
| **P1** | **Critical** | Major security incident with confirmed data exposure or significant service degradation | Unauthorized access to PII, API key compromise with data access, partial service outage affecting >50% users |
| **P2** | **High** | Security incident with potential data exposure or moderate service impact | Vulnerability actively exploited, unauthorized access detected but contained, service degradation affecting <50% users |
| **P3** | **Medium** | Security event requiring investigation with limited immediate impact | Suspicious access patterns, failed intrusion attempts, configuration drift detected, minor data quality issues |
| **P4** | **Low** | Minor security event or policy violation with no data impact | Phishing attempt blocked, minor policy violation, non-sensitive log exposure, informational security alert |

---

## 2. Response Time Requirements

| Level | Acknowledge | Triage | Initial Response | Resolution Target | Post-Mortem |
|-------|------------|--------|-----------------|-------------------|-------------|

## 8. Severity Decision Tree

Use this decision tree to classify incidents when severity is unclear:

```
Is there confirmed data exfiltration or complete system compromise?
  ├─ YES → P0 (Catastrophic)
  └─ NO
       Is there confirmed unauthorized access to PII or critical systems?
       ├─ YES → P1 (Critical)
       └─ NO
            Is there an active exploit or significant service degradation?
            ├─ YES → P2 (High)
            └─ NO
                 Is investigation required to determine impact?
                 ├─ YES → P3 (Medium)
                 └─ NO → P4 (Low)
```
