This document provides a tabletop exercise template for testing your organization's data breach response capabilities. Regular drills ensure your incident response team can execute effectively under pressure and identify gaps in your response procedures before a real incident occurs.

> **Recommended frequency:** Conduct at least one tabletop exercise annually (GDPR best practice) and within 30 days of any significant infrastructure change.

## 1. Exercise Overview

## 3. Drill Scenarios

Choose one or more scenarios for the exercise. Scenarios are tailored to the services and data types detected in your project.

### Scenario 1: Credential Stuffing Attack

**Severity:** High

**Setup:** Your monitoring system alerts that an unusually high number of failed login attempts have occurred over the past 6 hours, with a 3% success rate. Approximately 2,500 accounts have been accessed using credentials obtained from a third-party breach.

**Data at risk:**
- User profile information (names, email addresses)
- Stored payment methods (last 4 digits, billing addresses)
- Account activity history

**Injects (reveal at timed intervals):**

| Time | Inject |
|------|--------|
| T+15min | A security researcher contacts you via responsible disclosure email about the attack |
| T+30min | Affected users start posting on social media about unauthorized access |
| T+45min | A journalist emails your press contact asking for comment |
| T+60min | You discover the attackers exported personal data from 150 accounts |
| T+75min | Three users report unauthorized charges on their payment methods |

### Scenario 2: Exposed Database / Storage Bucket

**Severity:** Critical

**Setup:** A security researcher reports via your responsible disclosure program that a database backup or storage bucket containing production data is publicly accessible. The exposure has been active for approximately 14 days. The researcher provides evidence including sample records.

**Data at risk:**
- user prompts
- conversation history
- generated content
- real-time user data
- connection metadata
- channel subscriptions
- WebSocket messages
- uploaded files
- file metadata
- storage service credentials
- potential PII in uploaded content
- image versions
- channel group data
- IP address
- user behavior
- session recordings
- feature flag usage
- device information
- payment information
- billing address
- email
- transaction history
- user identity

**Injects:**

| Time | Inject |
|------|--------|
| T+15min | Shodan/Censys logs confirm the resource has been indexed by search engines |
| T+30min | Analysis reveals the data includes records from EU residents |
| T+45min | A tech blog publishes a story about the exposure (no company named yet) |
| T+60min | Your CEO asks for a status update and projected impact assessment |
| T+90min | The blog updates their article naming your company |

### Scenario 3: AI System Data Leak

**Severity:** High

**Setup:** A customer reports that your AI-powered feature is occasionally including personal data from other users in its responses. Investigation reveals a prompt injection vulnerability that allows extraction of conversation context from other sessions.

**Data at risk:**
- User prompts and conversation history
- Personal data shared in AI interactions
- Potentially sensitive business information processed by AI

**Injects:**

| Time | Inject |
|------|--------|
| T+15min | A proof-of-concept exploit is shared on a security forum |
| T+30min | You estimate ~500 users may have had data exposed through cross-session leakage |
| T+45min | A researcher demonstrates the exploit can extract data from enterprise customer accounts |
| T+60min | An enterprise customer's legal team contacts you demanding information |

### Scenario 4: Supply Chain Compromise

**Severity:** Critical

**Setup:** A widely-used npm package in your dependency tree has been compromised. The malicious version exfiltrates environment variables (including API keys and database credentials) to an external server. Your CI/CD pipeline installed the compromised version 3 days ago.

**Data at risk:**
- API keys and secrets from environment variables
- Database credentials (potential access to all stored data)
- Third-party service credentials
- Any data accessible via compromised credentials

**Injects:**

| Time | Inject |
|------|--------|
| T+15min | npm advisory confirms the compromise affecting your exact version range |
| T+30min | Logs show outbound connections to an unknown IP from production servers |
| T+45min | You cannot determine with certainty whether database data was accessed |
| T+60min | A second compromised package is discovered in the same dependency tree |

## 4. Exercise Timeline

The exercise follows the standard incident response phases. The facilitator controls the pace and introduces injects at appropriate moments.

| Phase | Duration | Activities |
|-------|----------|------------|
| **Briefing** | 15 min | Facilitator sets the scene, distributes scenario, confirms roles |
| **Phase 1: Detection & Analysis** | 30 min | Initial triage, severity assessment, evidence collection, scope determination |
| **Phase 2: Containment** | 30 min | Immediate containment actions, communication plan, authority notification assessment |
| **Phase 3: Eradication & Recovery** | 30 min | Root cause elimination, system restoration, monitoring enhancement |
| **Phase 4: Notification** | 20 min | Draft notifications (authority, individuals), legal review, communication approval |
| **Phase 5: Post-Incident** | 15 min | Lessons learned, action items, documentation review |
| **Debrief** | 20 min | Evaluator shares observations, team discussion, improvement planning |

## 5. Discussion Questions by Phase

### Phase 1: Detection & Analysis

- How was the breach detected? Could it have been detected earlier?
- What monitoring and alerting tools are available? Were they effective?
- How do you determine the scope of the breach (which data, how many records, which users)?
- What evidence needs to be preserved, and how do you ensure chain of custody?
- Who needs to be notified internally at this stage?

### Phase 2: Containment

- What immediate technical actions can contain the breach?
- How do you balance containment speed vs. preserving forensic evidence?
- Who has the authority to take systems offline if needed?
- How do you communicate with the team during an active incident?
- What is the impact of containment measures on business operations?

### Phase 3: Eradication & Recovery

- How do you confirm the root cause has been eliminated?
- What is the recovery sequence for affected systems?
- How do you verify system integrity before bringing services back online?
- What enhanced monitoring should be in place during recovery?

### Phase 4: Notification

- Does this breach meet the GDPR 72-hour notification threshold?
- Which supervisory authorities need to be notified?
- Does this breach require individual notification to affected data subjects (GDPR Art. 34)?
- What US state notification requirements apply?
- Who drafts, reviews, and approves external notifications?
- How do you handle media inquiries during this period?

### Phase 5: Post-Incident

- What went well during the response?
- What gaps or delays were identified?
- What process improvements are needed?
- What technical controls should be added or enhanced?
- How should the Incident Response Plan be updated?
