## 1. What is a DSAR?

A **Data Subject Access Request (DSAR)** is a request made by an individual (the "data subject") to exercise their rights over their personal data. These rights are established under:

- **GDPR Articles 15-22** (European Union)
- **CCPA/CPRA Sections 1798.100-1798.199** (California, USA)

Data subjects have the right to know what personal data is collected about them, how it is used, and to request changes or deletion of that data. Organizations must respond to these requests within legally mandated timeframes.

### Legal Basis

| Right | GDPR Article | CCPA Section |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| Right of Access | Art. 15 | \u00A71798.100, \u00A71798.110 |
| Right to Rectification | Art. 16 | \u00A71798.106 |
| Right to Erasure ("Right to be Forgotten") | Art. 17 | \u00A71798.105 |
| Right to Data Portability | Art. 20 | \u00A71798.100 |
| Right to Restriction of Processing | Art. 18 | N/A |
| Right to Object | Art. 21 | \u00A71798.120 (opt-out of sale/sharing) |`);

  // ── Types of Requests ──────────────────────────────────────────

  sections.push(`
---

## 2. Types of DSAR Requests

### 2.1 Access Request (GDPR Art. 15 / CCPA \u00A71798.110)

The data subject requests a copy of all personal data you hold about them, including:
- Categories of data processed
- Purposes of processing
- Recipients or categories of recipients
- Retention periods
- Source of the data (if not collected directly)

### 2.2 Rectification Request (GDPR Art. 16)

The data subject requests correction of inaccurate personal data or completion of incomplete data.

### 2.3 Erasure Request (GDPR Art. 17 / CCPA \u00A71798.105)

The data subject requests deletion of their personal data. This right applies when:
- Data is no longer necessary for the original purpose
- Consent is withdrawn
- The data subject objects and there are no overriding legitimate grounds
- Data was unlawfully processed

**Exceptions:** You may retain data required for legal compliance, exercise of legal claims, or public interest.

### 2.4 Data Portability Request (GDPR Art. 20 / CCPA \u00A71798.100)

The data subject requests their data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format (e.g., JSON, CSV) for transfer to another controller.

### 2.5 Restriction of Processing (GDPR Art. 18)

The data subject requests that processing be limited (data is stored but not actively processed) while:
- Accuracy is contested
- Processing is unlawful but the subject opposes erasure
- The controller no longer needs the data but the subject needs it for legal claims

### 2.6 Right to Object (GDPR Art. 21 / CCPA \u00A71798.120)

The data subject objects to processing based on legitimate interests, direct marketing, or profiling. For CCPA, this includes the right to opt out of the sale or sharing of personal information.`);

  sections.push(`
---

## 3. Response Timeline

### GDPR Timeline

| Step | Deadline |
|------|----------|
| Acknowledge receipt | Within 3 business days |
| Verify identity | Within 5 business days |
| Respond to request | **30 calendar days** from receipt |
| Extension (complex requests) | Up to **60 additional days** (90 days total) with notification to the data subject |

### CCPA/CPRA Timeline

| Step | Deadline |
|------|----------|
| Acknowledge receipt | Within **10 business days** |
| Verify identity | Within 10 business days |
| Respond to request | **45 calendar days** from receipt |
| Extension (if necessary) | Up to **45 additional days** (90 days total) with notification to the consumer |

### Key Differences

- **GDPR:** 30-day default, extendable to 90 days for complex requests
- **CCPA:** 45-day default, extendable to 90 days
- **Both:** Extensions require notifying the data subject with reasons for the delay
- **GDPR:** First copy is free; subsequent copies may incur a reasonable fee
- **CCPA:** Requests must be fulfilled free of charge (up to 2 requests per 12-month period)`);

  // ── Identity Verification ──────────────────────────────────────

  sections.push(`
---

## 4. Identity Verification Requirements

Before processing any DSAR, you **must** verify the identity of the requester to prevent unauthorized disclosure of personal data.

### Verification Methods

1. **Existing Account Holders:**
   - Require the request to be submitted from the registered email address
   - Send a verification email with a one-time confirmation link
   - Require re-authentication through the application's login flow

2. **Non-Account Holders / Unverifiable Requests:**
   - Request two or more pieces of identifying information that match your records
   - Examples: full name, email, account number, recent transaction details
   - If identity cannot be verified, notify the requester within the response deadline and explain what additional information is needed

3. **Authorized Agents (CCPA):**
   - Verify the agent's authorization (signed permission or power of attorney)
   - Verify the identity of the consumer on whose behalf the request is made
   - Exception: no consumer verification needed if the agent has a valid power of attorney

### Documentation

- Record the verification method used for each request
- Document any failed verification attempts
- Retain verification records for the duration required by applicable law`);

## 6. Third-Party Sub-Processor Notification

1. Forward the DSAR to each relevant sub-processor listed above
2. Set a follow-up reminder for 14 days to confirm completion
3. Document each sub-processor's response
4. Inform the data subject of any sub-processors that could not comply, and the reasons`;
