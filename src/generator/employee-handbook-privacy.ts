**Organization:** ${company}

It describes the company's policies on workplace monitoring, device usage, email monitoring, and employee data privacy. All employees and contractors are expected to read and acknowledge this section.

## ${next()}. Purpose & Scope

This section of the employee handbook establishes ${company}'s policies regarding:

- **Workplace monitoring** — what tools are used and what data they collect
- **Device usage** — policies for company-issued and personal (BYOD) devices
- **Email and communication monitoring** — what is monitored and why
- **Employee data privacy** — your rights and our obligations

These policies apply to all employees, contractors, interns, and temporary workers who use ${company}'s systems, networks, or devices.`);

### 2.1 Monitoring Principles

${company} monitors certain workplace systems for the following legitimate purposes:

- **Security** — detecting and preventing unauthorized access, data breaches, and cyber threats
- **Compliance** — meeting regulatory obligations and audit requirements
- **Performance** — ensuring system reliability, uptime, and error resolution
- **Legal** — preserving evidence where required by law or regulation

Monitoring is conducted on the principle of **proportionality** — we collect only what is necessary for the stated purposes and do not engage in excessive surveillance.`;
