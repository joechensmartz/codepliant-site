## Article 53 Compliance Summary

The EU AI Act Article 53 requires providers of general-purpose AI models to:

### 53(1) — Technical Documentation
- [ ] Maintain up-to-date technical documentation for each GPAI model used
- [ ] Documentation covers model training, testing, and evaluation results
- [ ] Information is sufficient for downstream providers to comply with their obligations

### 53(1)(a) — Model Identification
- [ ] Each AI model is clearly identified with name, version, and provider
- [ ] Model capabilities and limitations are documented
- [ ] Intended and foreseeable use cases are described

### 53(1)(b) — Training & Testing
- [ ] Training data sources and governance are documented (or referenced from provider)
- [ ] Evaluation results and benchmark performance are recorded
- [ ] Testing methodology is described or referenced

### 53(1)(c) — Integration Information
- [ ] Information for downstream integrators is provided
- [ ] API usage, data flow, and processing scope are documented
- [ ] Known risks and mitigation measures are communicated

### 53(1)(d) — Copyright Compliance
- [ ] Provider's copyright policy for training data is reviewed
- [ ] EU Copyright Directive (Directive (EU) 2019/790) compliance is verified with provider
- [ ] Text and data mining opt-out mechanisms are documented where applicable

### 53(2) — Systemic Risk (if applicable)
- [ ] Assess whether any GPAI model used has systemic risk (>10^25 FLOPs or EC designation)
- [ ] If systemic risk applies, additional obligations under Article 55 must be met
- [ ] Model evaluation and adversarial testing documentation is maintained

> **Note:** As a deployer (not provider) of GPAI models, your primary obligation is to ensure that the AI providers you use comply with Article 53. This checklist helps you verify and document that compliance.`);
