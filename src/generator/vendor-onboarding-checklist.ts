  sections.push(`
## ${next()}. Ongoing Vendor Monitoring

After onboarding, vendors are subject to periodic review:

| Review Activity | Frequency | Responsible |
|----------------|-----------|-------------|
| Security certification renewal check | Annual | Security/IT |
| DPA review and update | Annual | Legal/Privacy |
| Sub-processor list review | Quarterly | DPO |
| Access audit (who has access to what) | Quarterly | Engineering |
| SLA performance review | Quarterly | Engineering |
| Penetration test report review | Annual | Security/IT |
| Data classification review | Annual | DPO |
| Full vendor risk reassessment | Annual | DPO + Security |

### Vendor Removal Triggers

A vendor should be flagged for removal or replacement if:

- Security certification lapses or is revoked
- Data breach occurs with inadequate response
- SLA commitments are repeatedly missed
- Vendor fails to support DSAR fulfillment
- Sub-processor changes introduce unacceptable risk
- Vendor is acquired by an entity in a jurisdiction with inadequate data protection
