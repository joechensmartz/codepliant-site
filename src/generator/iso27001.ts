It is not a substitute for a formal ISO 27001 certification audit or professional guidance. Engage a qualified certification body for your official assessment.

## 1. Overview

This checklist helps ${company} prepare for ISO 27001 certification by mapping detected services and infrastructure to the Annex A controls defined in ISO/IEC 27001:2022. Each section contains actionable items tailored to your project's technology stack.

ISO 27001 requires an Information Security Management System (ISMS) that addresses risks through a combination of organizational, people, physical, and technological controls.

**Detected services:** ${scan.services.length}
**Applicable Annex A domains:** ${Array.from(getRelevantDomains(scan.services)).map((d) => ANNEX_A_DOMAINS[d] || d).join(", ")}`);

| Phase | Duration | Activities |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| **Gap Analysis** | 2-4 weeks | Assess current controls against ISO 27001 requirements |
| **Risk Assessment** | 2-4 weeks | Identify, analyze, and evaluate information security risks |
| **ISMS Design** | 4-8 weeks | Define ISMS scope, policies, and control objectives |
| **Implementation** | 8-16 weeks | Implement controls, procedures, and documentation |
| **Internal Audit** | 2-4 weeks | Conduct internal audit to verify ISMS effectiveness |
| **Management Review** | 1-2 weeks | Review ISMS performance and approve for certification |
| **Stage 1 Audit** | 1-2 weeks | Certification body reviews documentation and readiness |
| **Stage 2 Audit** | 1-2 weeks | Certification body verifies implementation and effectiveness |`);

## 6. Next Steps

1. **Appoint an ISMS owner** responsible for driving the certification process.
2. **Define the ISMS scope** — which business units, locations, and systems are included.
3. **Conduct a risk assessment** to identify threats and vulnerabilities to your information assets.
4. **Prioritize controls** starting with A.5 (Organizational) and A.8 (Technological) — these have the broadest impact.
5. **Begin documentation** — ISO 27001 requires documented policies, procedures, and evidence of control operation.
6. **Engage a certification body** early to align on scope and expectations.
