### ${sectionNum}.3 Review Process

| Step | Description | Timeline |
|------|-------------|----------|
| 1. Acknowledgment | We confirm receipt of your request | Within 1 business day |
| 2. Review | We evaluate your request against our refund criteria | 3-5 business days |
| 3. Decision | We notify you of the outcome | Within 5 business days of submission |
| 4. Processing | Approved refunds are processed | 5-10 business days after approval |

## ${nextSection()}. Refund Timeline

Once a refund is approved, the timeline for receiving your refund depends on the original payment method:

| Payment Method | Refund Timeline |
|---------------|-----------------|
| Credit/Debit Card | 5-10 business days |
| Bank Transfer | 5-15 business days |
| PayPal / Digital Wallet | 3-5 business days |
| Cryptocurrency | Not eligible for monetary refund; account credit may be issued |

Refunds are issued to the original payment method used for the purchase. We cannot process refunds to a different payment method.

## ${nextSection()}. Partial Refunds

In certain circumstances, we may issue a partial refund:

- If you have used a significant portion of the service before requesting a refund
- If the refund request is made after the full refund eligibility window but within a reasonable timeframe
- If only a portion of the service was unsatisfactory

Partial refund amounts are calculated based on the unused portion of the service, minus any applicable fees.

## ${nextSection()}. Chargebacks and Disputes

If you initiate a chargeback or payment dispute with your bank or payment provider before contacting us:

- Your account may be suspended pending resolution of the dispute
- We reserve the right to contest the chargeback with evidence of service delivery
- If the chargeback is resolved in our favor, you may be responsible for any associated fees

We encourage you to contact us directly at ${email} before initiating a chargeback, as we can often resolve issues more quickly.

## ${nextSection()}. Cancellation vs. Refund

- **Cancellation** stops future billing. Your access continues until the end of the current billing period.
- **Refund** returns money for charges already made.

Cancelling your subscription does not automatically entitle you to a refund for the current billing period. If you wish to request a refund in addition to cancelling, please follow the refund process described above.

## ${nextSection()}. Consumer Protection Rights

This Refund Policy does not affect your statutory rights under applicable consumer protection laws in ${jurisdiction}. If local law provides you with a longer refund period or additional protections, those rights take precedence over this policy.

For customers in the European Union:
- You have a 14-day right of withdrawal for online purchases under the Consumer Rights Directive
- This right may not apply to digital content once download or streaming has begun with your prior consent

## ${nextSection()}. Exceptions and Special Circumstances

We may make exceptions to this policy in cases of:

- Service outages or degraded performance caused by ${company}
- Billing errors or unauthorized charges
- Documented cases where the service did not perform as advertised
- Extenuating personal circumstances (evaluated on a case-by-case basis)

## ${nextSection()}. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Refund Policy from time to time. Changes will be posted on our website at ${website}. The updated policy applies to purchases made after the effective date of the change. Existing purchases remain subject to the policy in effect at the time of purchase.
