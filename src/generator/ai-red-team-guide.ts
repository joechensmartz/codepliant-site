- Execute OWASP LLM Top 10 test cases
- Execute provider-specific test cases
- Execute bias probing tests
- Execute data extraction tests
- Document all findings with evidence

#### Phase 3: Exploitation (Day 4)
- Chain discovered vulnerabilities for maximum impact
- Test mitigations and bypass techniques
- Attempt multi-step attack scenarios
- Validate severity ratings

#### Phase 4: Reporting (Day 5)
- Compile findings into structured report
- Prioritise by severity and exploitability
- Propose specific remediation steps
- Schedule follow-up retesting

### Severity Classification

| Severity | Description | Response Time |
|----------|-------------|---------------|
| Critical | System prompt extraction, PII leakage, arbitrary code execution | 24 hours |
| High | Significant bias, data extraction, privilege escalation | 1 week |
