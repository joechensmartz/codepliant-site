This data is collected through ${scan.services.length} integrated service(s): ${serviceNames.join(", ")}.

### Q2: Why do you collect this data?

We collect data only when necessary to:

- **Provide our service** — core functionality requires certain data to operate
- **Ensure security** — protecting your account and our infrastructure${hasAnalytics ? "\n- **Improve our product** — understanding usage patterns helps us build better features" : ""}${hasPayment ? "\n- **Process payments** — completing transactions you initiate" : ""}${hasAI ? "\n- **Power AI features** — delivering AI-assisted functionality you request" : ""}
- **Comply with law** — meeting legal obligations (tax records, fraud prevention)

### Q3: Do you collect data from children?

No. Our service is not directed at children under 16 (or 13 in the US). We do not knowingly collect personal data from children. If we learn that we have collected data from a child, we will delete it promptly. Contact ${email} if you believe a child has provided us data.`);
