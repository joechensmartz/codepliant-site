**Last updated:** ${date}

**Project:** ${scan.projectName}

**Company:** ${company}

---

## 1. Purpose

This policy establishes access control requirements for the **${scan.projectName}** application, including role-based access control (RBAC), authentication standards, password policies, session management, and multi-factor authentication (MFA) requirements. It supports compliance with GDPR Article 32 (security of processing), SOC 2 CC6.1–CC6.3, and ISO 27001 Annex A.9.

## 2. Scope

This policy applies to all users, administrators, and service accounts that access the application, its data, and its infrastructure.

## 3. Detected Authentication Services

The following authentication services were detected in the codebase:

| Service | Data Collected |
|---------|---------------|`);

    sections.push(`| ${s.name} | ${s.dataCollected.join(", ")} |`);

## 4. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

### 4.1 Role Definitions

| Role | Description | Access Level |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| Super Admin | Full system access including user management and configuration | Full |
| Admin | Application administration, user management, content moderation | High |
| Manager | Team management, reporting, limited configuration | Medium-High |
| User | Standard application features, own data management | Standard |
| Viewer | Read-only access to permitted resources | Read-Only |
| API Service | Machine-to-machine access via API keys or service tokens | Scoped |

### 4.2 Principle of Least Privilege

1. All accounts must be assigned the **minimum permissions** required for their function
2. Administrative privileges must be granted only when explicitly required and approved
3. Service accounts must have **scoped permissions** limited to their specific function
4. Elevated privileges must be **time-bounded** and reviewed regularly

### 4.3 Access Provisioning

1. Access requests must be submitted through a documented approval process
2. New accounts default to the **lowest privilege level** (Viewer or User)
3. Privilege escalation requires manager approval and documented justification
4. Access must be **revoked immediately** upon role change or employment termination

### 4.4 Access Review Schedule

| Review Type | Frequency | Responsible Party |
|------------|-----------|-------------------|
| User access audit | Quarterly | Security team |
| Admin privilege review | Monthly | Engineering lead |
| Service account audit | Quarterly | DevOps team |
| Inactive account cleanup | Monthly | IT operations |
| Third-party access review | Quarterly | Security team |`);

  // ── Password Policy ────────────────────────────────────────────────
  sections.push(`

## 5. Password Policy

### 5.1 Password Requirements

| Requirement | Standard |
|------------|----------|
| Minimum length | 12 characters |
| Complexity | At least 3 of: uppercase, lowercase, numbers, special characters |
| Maximum age | 90 days (recommended: no forced rotation if strong + MFA) |
| History | Cannot reuse last 12 passwords |
| Lockout threshold | 5 failed attempts |
| Lockout duration | 15 minutes (progressive increase) |

### 5.2 Password Storage

1. Passwords must be **hashed** using bcrypt, scrypt, or Argon2id (never MD5 or SHA-1)
2. A unique **salt** must be generated per password
3. Work factor must be set to at least **10 rounds** (bcrypt) or equivalent
4. Raw passwords must **never** be logged, stored in plaintext, or transmitted in URLs

### 5.3 Password Reset

1. Password reset links must expire within **1 hour**
2. Reset tokens must be cryptographically random (minimum 128 bits)
3. Previous sessions must be **invalidated** upon password change
4. Users must be notified via email when their password is changed`);

  // ── Session Management ─────────────────────────────────────────────
  sections.push(`
---

## 6. Session Management

### 6.1 Session Configuration

| Parameter | Requirement |
|-----------|------------|
| Session timeout (idle) | 30 minutes |
| Absolute session lifetime | 24 hours |
| Session token length | Minimum 128 bits of entropy |
| Token storage | HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite cookies |
| Token transmission | HTTPS only (TLS 1.2+) |

### 6.2 Session Security

1. Session tokens must be **regenerated** after authentication (prevent session fixation)
2. All sessions must be **invalidated** on logout
3. Users must be able to view and **terminate active sessions**
4. Concurrent session limits should be enforced for sensitive operations
5. Session data must be stored **server-side** (not in client-accessible cookies)`);

  if (hasOAuth) {
    sections.push(`
### 6.3 OAuth / SSO Session Management

1. OAuth tokens must be stored securely (encrypted at rest, never in localStorage)
2. Refresh tokens must have a **maximum lifetime** and be rotatable
3. Token revocation must be supported and enforced on logout
4. OAuth scopes must follow the principle of **least privilege**
5. SSO sessions must respect the IdP's session lifecycle`);

## 7. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

### 7.1 MFA Requirements

| User Type | MFA Requirement |
|-----------|----------------|
| Super Admin / Admin | **Required** — must be enforced |
| Users with access to PII | **Required** |
| Standard users | **Strongly recommended** |
| API / Service accounts | API key + IP allowlisting |`);

  if (hasPayment) {
    sections.push(`| Users with payment data access | **Required** — PCI DSS compliance |`);
  }
  if (hasAI) {
    sections.push(`| Users managing AI configurations | **Required** — prevent unauthorized model changes |`);
  }

  sections.push(`
### 7.2 Supported MFA Methods

| Method | Security Level | Recommendation |
|--------|---------------|----------------|
| TOTP (authenticator app) | High | **Recommended** — Google Authenticator, Authy, 1Password |
| WebAuthn / Passkeys | Very High | **Preferred** — hardware security keys, biometrics |
| SMS OTP | Medium | **Acceptable** — vulnerable to SIM swap; use as fallback only |
| Email OTP | Medium | **Acceptable** — use as fallback only |
| Push notification | High | **Recommended** — when supported by auth provider |`);

  if (hasWebAuthn) {
    sections.push(`
### 7.3 WebAuthn / Passkey Implementation

WebAuthn support was detected in the codebase. Ensure:

1. Attestation data is stored securely and associated with user accounts
2. Multiple authenticators can be registered per account
3. Recovery mechanisms exist for lost authenticators
4. Credential IDs are treated as sensitive data`);
  }

  if (!hasMFA && !hasWebAuthn) {
    sections.push(`
### 7.3 MFA Implementation Recommendation

No MFA implementation was detected in the codebase. **It is strongly recommended** to implement MFA, especially for:

1. Administrative accounts
2. Accounts with access to personal data
3. Accounts with access to financial data
4. Any account with elevated privileges

Consider integrating TOTP-based MFA (e.g., via ${authServices[0].name}) as a first step.`);

  // ── API Access ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────

## 8. API & Service Account Access

### 8.1 API Key Management

1. API keys must be generated with **sufficient entropy** (minimum 256 bits)
2. Keys must be **scoped** to specific operations and resources
3. Keys must have an **expiration date** (maximum 1 year)
4. Unused keys must be **revoked** after 90 days of inactivity
5. API keys must **never** be committed to version control

### 8.2 Service Account Standards

1. Service accounts must have a **named owner** (individual or team)
2. Service account credentials must be rotated at least **quarterly**
3. Service accounts must be excluded from interactive login
4. Service account activity must be **logged and monitored**`);

## 9. Access Monitoring & Alerting

### 9.1 Events to Monitor

| Event | Alert Priority |
|-------|---------------|
| Failed login attempts (5+ within 15 min) | High |
| Successful login from new device/location | Medium |
| Admin privilege escalation | Critical |
| Password change or reset | Medium |
| MFA enrollment or removal | High |
| API key creation or rotation | Medium |
| Service account activity outside normal hours | High |
| Bulk data access or export | Critical |

### 9.2 Response Procedures

1. High/Critical alerts must be investigated within **1 hour**
2. Suspicious accounts must be **temporarily suspended** pending investigation
3. Compromised credentials must be **immediately revoked**
4. Security incidents must follow the incident response plan (see INCIDENT_RESPONSE_PLAN.md)`);

## 10. Policy Review

This access control policy should be reviewed:

- **Quarterly** as part of the security review cycle
- **When adding** new authentication services or access patterns
- **After a security incident** involving unauthorized access
- **When regulatory requirements** change

For questions about this policy, contact ${email}.
