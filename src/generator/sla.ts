## ${nextSection()}. Overview

This Service Level Agreement ("SLA") describes the service level commitments that ${company} makes to customers for the Services described herein. This SLA is incorporated into and forms part of the agreement between ${company} and the customer ("Customer").

Monitoring and observability is provided through: ${monitoringNames}.

## ${nextSection()}. Definitions

- **"Downtime"** means any period during which the Services are unavailable to the Customer, as measured by our monitoring systems.
- **"Scheduled Maintenance"** means planned maintenance windows that are communicated to customers at least 48 hours in advance.
- **"Monthly Uptime Percentage"** means the total minutes in a calendar month minus the minutes of Downtime, divided by the total minutes in the month, expressed as a percentage.
- **"Service Credit"** means a credit issued to the Customer's account as a remedy for failure to meet SLA commitments.
- **"Incident"** means any unplanned interruption or degradation of the Services.

## ${nextSection()}. Service Level Objectives

### ${sectionNum}.1 Availability

${company} commits to the following uptime targets:

| Service Tier | Monthly Uptime Target | Maximum Monthly Downtime |
|-------------|----------------------|-------------------------|
| Standard | 99.5% | ~3 hours 39 minutes |
| Professional | 99.9% | ~43 minutes |
| Enterprise | 99.95% | ~22 minutes |

Scheduled Maintenance windows are excluded from uptime calculations. Maintenance windows are typically scheduled during low-traffic periods (weekends, 02:00-06:00 UTC).

### ${sectionNum}.2 Performance

| Metric | Target | Measurement |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| API Response Time (p50) | < 200ms | Measured at edge |
| API Response Time (p95) | < 500ms | Measured at edge |
| API Response Time (p99) | < 1000ms | Measured at edge |
| Page Load Time | < 3 seconds | Measured from client |
| Error Rate | < 0.1% | 5xx responses / total requests |`;

  if (hasDatabase) {
    doc += `
| Database Query Time (p95) | < 100ms | Measured at application layer |
| Data Durability | 99.999999999% | Eleven nines |`;

## ${nextSection()}. Incident Classification and Response Times

### ${sectionNum}.1 Severity Levels

| Severity | Definition | Examples |

| **P2 — High** | Major feature unavailable or severe degradation | ${hasAuth ? "Authentication failing, " : ""}${hasPayment ? "Payment processing errors, " : ""}Core functionality broken |
| **P3 — Medium** | Minor feature unavailable or moderate degradation | Non-critical feature broken, slow performance |
| **P4 — Low** | Cosmetic issues or minor inconveniences | UI glitches, documentation errors |

### ${sectionNum}.2 Response Times

| Severity | Initial Response | Status Updates | Resolution Target |
|----------|-----------------|----------------|-------------------|
| P1 — Critical | 15 minutes | Every 30 minutes | 4 hours |
| P2 — High | 1 hour | Every 2 hours | 8 hours |
| P3 — Medium | 4 hours | Every 8 hours | 3 business days |
