## 1. Introduction

This Data Retention Policy describes how ${company} retains, manages, and deletes personal data collected through our services. It supplements our Privacy Policy and applies to all personal data we process.

We retain personal data only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected, comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.

## 4. Data Deletion Request Process

You have the right to request deletion of your personal data at any time. To submit a deletion request:

### How to Request

1. **Email:** Send a deletion request to ${email} with the subject line "Data Deletion Request."
2. **Account settings:** If available, use the self-service account deletion option in your account settings.

### What Happens Next

1. **Acknowledgment:** We will acknowledge your request within 3 business days.
2. **Verification:** We will verify your identity to prevent unauthorized deletion.
3. **Processing:** Eligible data will be deleted from primary systems within 30 days of verification.
4. **Confirmation:** You will receive a confirmation email once deletion is complete.

### Exceptions

Certain data may not be eligible for immediate deletion:

- **Legal holds:** Data subject to active litigation, regulatory investigation, or legal preservation requirements.
- **Tax and financial records:** Transaction records that must be retained for the legally mandated period (typically 7 years).
- **Aggregated/anonymized data:** Fully anonymized data that can no longer be linked to you is not considered personal data and may be retained indefinitely.
- **Security logs:** Minimal security event logs may be retained to protect against fraud and abuse.

### Partial Deletion

If you request deletion of specific categories of data rather than full account deletion, we will process the request for those categories while preserving the rest of your account.`);

## 5. Backup Retention Policy

### Backup Schedule

${company} maintains regular backups to protect against data loss and ensure business continuity:

- **Daily backups:** Retained for 30 days
- **Weekly backups:** Retained for 90 days
- **Monthly backups:** Retained for 1 year

### Data Deletion in Backups

When personal data is deleted from primary systems:

1. The data will not be actively restored from backups.
2. Backup copies containing the deleted data will be purged as they naturally expire according to the backup rotation schedule above.
3. Maximum time for complete purge from all backup systems: **90 days** from deletion in primary systems.

### Backup Security

- All backups are encrypted at rest using industry-standard encryption (AES-256 or equivalent).
- Access to backup systems is restricted to authorized personnel only.
- Backup restoration is logged and audited.

### Disaster Recovery

In the event of a disaster recovery scenario where backups must be restored:

- Any previously processed deletion requests will be re-applied to the restored data.
- Affected individuals will be notified if their data is temporarily restored during recovery.`);

## 6. Retention Review Process

${company} conducts periodic reviews of its data retention practices:

- **Quarterly reviews:** Verify that automated purge processes are functioning correctly.
- **Annual reviews:** Assess whether retention periods remain appropriate and aligned with legal requirements.
- **Ad-hoc reviews:** Triggered by changes in applicable law, business operations, or service offerings.

All retention period changes are documented and communicated through an updated version of this policy.`);
