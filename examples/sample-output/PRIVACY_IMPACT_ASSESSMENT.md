> This Data Protection Impact Assessment is prepared pursuant to **Article 35 of the General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (GDPR)**. A DPIA is required when data processing is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, particularly when using new technologies.

## 1. Description of Processing

### 1.1 Overview

This assessment covers the data processing activities of the **acme-saas** application operated by Acme SaaS Inc.. The following describes the nature, scope, context, and purposes of processing.

### 1.2 Services and Data Processing Activities

The application integrates the following services that process personal data:

| Service | Category | Data Processed | Legal Basis |
|---------|----------|---------------|-------------|
| @anthropic-ai/sdk | ai | user prompts, conversation history, generated content | Consent / Legitimate interest |

## 2. Necessity and Proportionality Assessment

### 2.1 Lawfulness of Processing

Each data processing activity must have a valid legal basis under Article 6 GDPR:

| Processing Activity | Legal Basis | Justification |
|---------------------|-------------|---------------|
| AI processing via @anthropic-ai/sdk | Consent / Legitimate interest | Required for AI-powered features; user consent obtained before processing |
| Error/performance monitoring via @sentry/node | Legitimate interest | Legitimate interest in maintaining service reliability and security |
| Authentication via @supabase/supabase-js | Contractual necessity | Necessary to authenticate and maintain user sessions |
| AI processing via openai | Consent / Legitimate interest | Required for AI-powered features; user consent obtained before processing |
| Behavioral analytics via posthog | Consent | Used to understand usage patterns and improve the service; requires prior consent |
| Email communications via resend | Contractual necessity / Consent | Necessary for service communications; marketing requires separate consent |
| Payment processing via stripe | Contractual necessity | Necessary to process transactions requested by the user |

### 2.2 Data Minimization

The following data minimization measures should be verified:

**AI Services:**
- [ ] Only data strictly necessary for the AI feature is transmitted to the provider
- [ ] User prompts are not stored beyond the session unless the user explicitly opts in
- [ ] No special category data is included in AI requests without explicit consent

**Analytics Services:**
- [ ] IP anonymization is enabled
- [ ] Only necessary tracking events are collected
- [ ] Session recording excludes sensitive form fields
- [ ] Data retention periods are configured to the minimum necessary

### 2.3 Proportionality

- [ ] The processing is necessary to achieve the stated purpose and cannot be achieved by less intrusive means
- [ ] The volume of data collected is proportionate to the processing purpose
- [ ] Data retention periods are limited to what is strictly necessary
- [ ] Data subjects are clearly informed about the processing

> **Action required:** Document how each processing activity satisfies the necessity and proportionality requirements. Verify that less privacy-intrusive alternatives have been considered.

## 3. Risk Assessment

### 3.1 Methodology

Risk is assessed using a **likelihood x impact** matrix. Each data processing activity is scored on two dimensions:

**Likelihood** (probability of harm occurring):

| Score | Level | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Unlikely | Remote chance of occurrence |
| 2 | Possible | Could occur in some circumstances |
| 3 | Likely | Will probably occur |
| 4 | Almost Certain | Expected to occur in most circumstances |

**Impact** (severity of harm to data subjects):

| Score | Level | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Negligible | Minor inconvenience, easily recoverable |
| 2 | Limited | Some damage, recoverable with effort |
| 3 | Significant | Serious harm, difficult to recover |
| 4 | Maximum | Irreversible or very serious harm |

**Risk Rating:** Likelihood x Impact

| Rating | Score Range | Action Required |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|
| Low | 1-4 | Accept with standard controls |
| Medium | 5-8 | Mitigate with additional controls |
| High | 9-12 | Significant mitigation required before processing |
| Critical | 13-16 | Must not proceed without DPA consultation and substantial mitigation |

### 3.2 Risk Assessment Results

| 6 | Email communications via resend | email addresses, email content | 2 (Possible) | 2 (Limited) | **4** | **Low** |
| 7 | Payment processing via stripe | payment information, billing address, email, transaction history | 2 (Possible) | 4 (Maximum) | **8** | **Medium** |

### 3.3 Risk Summary

| Rating | Count |
|--------|-------|
| Critical | 0 |
| High | 1 |
| Medium | 4 |
| Low | 2 |
| **Total** | **7** |

## 4. High-Risk Processing Triggers

Article 35(3) GDPR and the EDPB Guidelines on DPIAs identify specific types of processing that are likely to result in high risk. The following assessment is based on detected services:

| Trigger | Status | Description |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| Large-Scale Profiling | **TRIGGERED** | Systematic evaluation of personal aspects based on automated processing, including profiling (Art. 35(3)(a)) |
| Systematic Monitoring | **TRIGGERED** | Systematic monitoring of a publicly accessible area on a large scale (Art. 35(3)(c)) |
| Sensitive / Special Category Data | **Not detected** | Processing of special categories of data on a large scale (Art. 35(3)(b)) |
| AI-Powered Decision Making | **TRIGGERED** | Automated decision-making with legal or similarly significant effects, including AI inference and content generation (Art. 22 GDPR) |

> **3 high-risk trigger(s) detected.** This DPIA is mandatory under Article 35 GDPR. Multiple triggers increase the overall risk profile.

## 5. Data Flow Diagram

A detailed data flow map showing how personal data is collected, stored, processed, and shared across all integrated services is available in the companion document:

> **See [DATA_FLOW_MAP.md](./DATA_FLOW_MAP.md)** for the complete data flow diagram.

The data flow map covers:

- **Collection points:** How and where personal data enters the system
- **Storage locations:** Where personal data is persisted
- **Sharing / third-party transfers:** Which services receive personal data and for what purpose
- **Cross-border transfers:** Data flows outside the EEA
