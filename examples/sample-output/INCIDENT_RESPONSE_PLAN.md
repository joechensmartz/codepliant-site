# Incident Response Plan

**Last updated:** 2026-03-16

This document outlines the incident response procedures for **Acme SaaS Inc.**. It covers detection, classification, notification, investigation, remediation, and post-incident review.

## 1. Incident Classification

All security incidents and data breaches are classified by severity to determine the appropriate response timeline and escalation path.

| Severity | Description | Response Time | Examples |
| -------- | ----------- | ------------- | -------- |
| **Critical (P1)** | Active data breach with confirmed data exfiltration or system compromise | Immediate (within 1 hour) | Unauthorized access to production database, ransomware, leaked credentials actively exploited |
| **High (P2)** | Confirmed security incident with potential data exposure | Within 4 hours | Vulnerability actively being exploited, unauthorized access detected, suspected data leak |
| **Medium (P3)** | Security event requiring investigation | Within 24 hours | Unusual access patterns, failed intrusion attempts, misconfiguration discovered |
| **Low (P4)** | Minor security event or policy violation | Within 72 hours | Phishing attempt blocked, minor policy violation, non-sensitive data exposure |

## 2. Detection and Reporting Procedures

### How to Report an Incident

Any employee, contractor, or third party who discovers or suspects a security incident must report it immediately:

1. **Email:** [privacy@acme-saas.com](mailto:privacy@acme-saas.com)
2. **Escalation:** Contact the DPO at [dpo@acme-saas.com](mailto:dpo@acme-saas.com)
3. **Do NOT** attempt to investigate or remediate the issue independently
4. **Do NOT** communicate about the incident on public channels

### Information to Include

- Date and time the incident was discovered
- Description of what occurred
- Systems, services, or data affected
- How the incident was detected
- Any actions already taken
- Contact information of the reporter

## 3. GDPR 72-Hour Notification Requirement

Under Article 33 of the GDPR, personal data breaches must be reported to the relevant supervisory authority **within 72 hours** of becoming aware of the breach, unless the breach is unlikely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of individuals.

### Timeline

| Milestone | Deadline |
| --------- | -------- |
| Breach discovered | T = 0 |
| Internal assessment complete | T + 24 hours |
| Decision on notification obligation | T + 36 hours |
| Supervisory authority notified | T + 72 hours (maximum) |
| Affected individuals notified (if high risk) | Without undue delay |

If notification cannot be made within 72 hours, the reasons for the delay must be documented and communicated to the authority.

## 4. Authority Notification Template

Use the following template when notifying the supervisory authority of a personal data breach:

```

## 6. Investigation Procedures

Upon confirmation of a security incident, the incident response team must:

### 6.1 Containment

- [ ] Isolate affected systems from the network
- [ ] Revoke compromised credentials and API keys
- [ ] Block malicious IP addresses or accounts
- [ ] Preserve forensic evidence (logs, snapshots, memory dumps)
- [ ] Activate backup communication channels if primary channels are compromised

### 6.2 Investigation

- [ ] Determine the root cause of the incident
- [ ] Identify all affected systems, services, and data
- [ ] Determine the scope of data exposure
- [ ] Review access logs and audit trails
- [ ] Interview relevant personnel
- [ ] Document timeline of events
- [ ] Engage external forensic specialists if needed

## 7. Remediation Steps

- [ ] Patch or fix the vulnerability that led to the incident
- [ ] Rotate all potentially compromised secrets, keys, and tokens
- [ ] Force password resets for affected user accounts
- [ ] Update firewall rules and access controls
- [ ] Deploy additional monitoring on affected systems
- [ ] Verify that the attack vector is fully closed
- [ ] Conduct a follow-up scan to confirm no persistence mechanisms remain
- [ ] Update security documentation and runbooks

## 8. Post-Incident Review

A post-incident review (blameless post-mortem) must be conducted within **5 business days** of incident resolution.

### Review Agenda

1. **Timeline reconstruction** — What happened, and when?
2. **Root cause analysis** — Why did it happen?
3. **Detection assessment** — How was the incident detected? Could it have been detected sooner?
4. **Response evaluation** — Was the response effective? What worked well?
5. **Gap identification** — What controls, processes, or tools were missing?
6. **Action items** — Concrete tasks with owners and deadlines to prevent recurrence

### Documentation

The post-incident report must include:

- Incident summary and severity classification
- Complete timeline of events
- Root cause and contributing factors
- Data impact assessment
- Remediation actions taken
- Lessons learned
- Preventive action items with owners and due dates

## 10. AI Incident Handling

This project integrates with AI services. The following additional procedures apply to AI-related incidents.

### AI-Specific Incident Types

| Incident Type | Description | Severity |
| ------------- | ----------- | -------- |
| **Data leak via AI** | User data or sensitive information exposed through AI model inputs/outputs | Critical (P1) |
| **Prompt injection** | Malicious prompts bypass safety controls to extract data or alter behavior | High (P2) |
| **Bias incident** | AI produces discriminatory, harmful, or biased outputs at scale | High (P2) |
| **Hallucination impact** | AI generates false information that causes user harm or legal liability | Medium–High |
| **Model manipulation** | Adversarial inputs cause the AI to produce unauthorized outputs | High (P2) |

### AI Incident Response Steps

1. **Contain** — Disable or throttle the affected AI feature immediately
2. **Assess data exposure** — Determine if user data was leaked to or through the AI service
3. **Review AI provider logs** — Request audit logs from the AI service provider
4. **Evaluate downstream impact** — Assess whether AI outputs were stored, shared, or acted upon
5. **Notify AI provider** — Report the incident to the AI service provider per your agreement
6. **Update safeguards** — Strengthen input validation, output filtering, and prompt guardrails
7. **Document** — Record the incident with specific attention to data flow through AI services

## 11. PCI DSS Incident Procedures

This project processes payment data. The following PCI DSS-specific procedures apply to incidents involving cardholder data.

### PCI Incident Requirements

- [ ] Immediately contain and limit the exposure of cardholder data
- [ ] Notify your payment processor (e.g., Stripe, PayPal) within **24 hours** of discovering a breach
- [ ] Notify the relevant card brands (Visa, Mastercard, etc.) per their specific timelines
- [ ] Engage a PCI Forensic Investigator (PFI) if required by the card brands
- [ ] Preserve all evidence for forensic investigation
- [ ] Do NOT restart or alter compromised systems until forensic evidence is collected

### Payment Data Breach Checklist

- [ ] Confirm whether primary account numbers (PANs) were exposed
- [ ] Determine if CVV/CVC or PIN data was compromised
- [ ] Verify that cardholder data was being handled per PCI DSS requirements
- [ ] Document all compromised merchant IDs and terminal IDs
- [ ] Prepare for potential PCI DSS re-certification
