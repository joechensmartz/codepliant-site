> **Disclaimer:** This checklist is generated based on automated code analysis and is intended as a starting point for SOC 2 Type II readiness. It is not a substitute for a formal SOC 2 audit or professional guidance. Engage a qualified CPA firm for your official SOC 2 examination.

## 1. Overview

This checklist helps Acme SaaS Inc. prepare for a SOC 2 Type II audit by mapping detected services and infrastructure to the five Trust Services Criteria (TSC). Each section contains actionable items tailored to your project's technology stack.

**Detected services:** 7
**Relevant SOC 2 sections:** Processing Integrity (PI1), Confidentiality (C1), Privacy (P1-P8), Availability (A1), Security (CC6)

## 6. Next Steps

1. **Assign an owner** for each control area listed above.
2. **Conduct a gap assessment** comparing your current controls to this checklist.
3. **Prioritize remediation** starting with Security (CC6) and Availability (A1).
4. **Begin evidence collection** immediately — SOC 2 Type II requires evidence over a 6-12 month observation period.
5. **Engage an auditor** early to align on scope and expectations.
