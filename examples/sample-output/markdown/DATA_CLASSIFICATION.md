## Recommendations

### Special Category Data (Art. 9) — 2 field(s)

- **Explicit consent required** (Art. 9(2)(a)): Standard consent is not sufficient; obtain explicit, informed consent for each specific purpose
- **Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA)** required under Art. 35 before processing
- **Appoint a Data Protection Officer (DPO)** if processing special categories at scale
- **Encryption at rest and in transit** is mandatory; consider additional access controls
- **Minimize collection**: Only collect what is strictly necessary for the stated purpose
- **Audit logging**: Maintain detailed access logs for all special category data

### High Sensitivity Data — 8 field(s)

- **Encrypt at rest and in transit** using industry-standard algorithms (AES-256, TLS 1.2+)
- **Tokenize payment data** — never store raw card numbers (PCI DSS requirement)

- **Limit access** to personnel with a business need; implement role-based access control
- **Retain per regulatory requirements** (e.g., 7 years for financial records)

- **Allow user access and deletion** per GDPR Art. 15-17 (right of access, rectification, erasure)
- **Pseudonymize** where possible to reduce risk
- **Define clear retention periods** and automate data deletion

### Low Sensitivity Data — 27 field(s)

- **Encrypt in transit** (TLS 1.2+)
- **Anonymize or aggregate** analytics data where possible
- **Honor Do Not Track / Global Privacy Control** signals
- **Set appropriate retention periods** (typically 90 days for logs, 26 months for analytics)
- **Disclose in privacy policy** even for low-sensitivity data
